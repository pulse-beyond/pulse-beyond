 Sony turns off the TV 
↳ Why it matters 
News broke this past week that Sony is ceding control of its home entertainment 
business to TCL, which will hold a majority stake in a newly formed company. 
Sony’s decision to spin off its television business, which among others 
manufactures Bravia products, marks more than a corporate restructuring. It 
reflects  a deeper shift in where value is created in the global tech industry. Control 
of a core hardware operation is moving from a Japanese icon to a Chinese 
manufacturer, reinforcing a long-term trend: electronics manufacturing is 
becoming increasingly commoditized, scale-driven and dominated by Chinese 
players. 
By the way, wherever you are in the world, expect many new Chinese brands you 
have never heard of to enter your market in the years to come. Times are changing, 
and so are TV shows and TV set manufacturers. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
This shift didn’t happen overnight. I remember participating in discussions more 
than a decade ago in Seoul, South Korea, where KIST and ETRI leaders and 
policymakers openly acknowledged their strength in devices and semiconductors, 
but their weakness in platforms and content, highlighting that Korea’s future 
strategy would focus precisely on closing that gap. Fast forward to today, and 
----------------Page (0) Break----------------
Korean movies win Oscars, K-pop dominates global charts, and Korean formats 
flood streaming platforms worldwide. 
Sony seems to be reading the same map—to be fair, they saw it before others and 
acquired Columbia Pictures back in 1989. Hardware builds reach, but content 
builds power. The strategic questions for any advanced or aspiring economy are no 
longer how to make better devices, but (1) how to control the core technologies 
behind them—semiconductors being the clearest example—and (2) how to design, 
own and scale cultural and digital assets globally. Sony’s decision feels less like 
retreat and more like focus. That said: can Japan rebuild its edge in 
semiconductors? How? 
 Space is getting crowded 
↳ Why it matters 
Earth’s orbit is becoming increasingly congested, and this past week global media 
reported that Chinese satellites and space debris forced SpaceX’s Starlink fleet to 
execute a record number of collision-avoidance manoeuvres in 2025. Looking 
ahead, things will only get worse — more crowded, more complicated, riskier and 
costlier. 
Thousands of satellites and millions of debris fragments are now moving at 
extreme speeds above us, dramatically increasing collision risks. A single impact 
can destroy assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars and generate even more 
debris, amplifying the problem. This congestion raises operational risk, insurance 
costs, and uncertainty for governments and private operators alike. 
At the same time, it creates a fast-growing market for space situational awareness: 
companies that can track objects, predict collisions, and provide timely alerts 
capable of saving satellites and entire constellations. A new ecosystem is emerging 
around this need, with players such as LeoLabs from the United States, Neuraspace 
----------------Page (1) Break----------------
from Portugal, Spaceflux    from the United Kingdom, Share My Space from France, 
and NorthStar Earth & Space from Canada positioning themselves as the future “air 
traffic  controllers” of Earth’s orbit. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
I often write about space in this Snapshot because it is rapidly becoming a major 
economy, I am deeply interested in new technologies and new industries, and I am 
part of Seldor Capital, a VC firm  that invests in space tech. And everything 
space-related is changing fast, attracting attention, new players and investment in 
new assets on Earth and far above our heads. As the space economy grows, new 
problems inevitably surface, opening space for new types of activities and players, 
as in any other economy that matures and becomes more sophisticated. Space 
traffic  management will soon resemble air traffic  control, but without a shared 
global authority, clear legal frameworks, or agreed-upon rules of responsibility. 
Those who can foresee now future necessities and act will be better positioned to 
profit in the future. 
To add complexity to the matter, in a fragmented geopolitical world, coordination 
becomes harder just as it becomes more necessary. Who is liable when objects 
collide? Who pays for cleanup? And who decides whose satellite moves first? 
These questions remain largely unanswered, yet they will define  space usability — 
and costs and risks — in the long run. 
 Africa’s got talent! Opportunities? 
↳ Why it matters 
Africa’s population is young and growing fast—the continent is projected to be 
home to 40% of the world’s population by the end of the century—and increasingly 
connected. It holds one of the largest untapped pools of human potential in the 
world. But unlocking that potential depends on providing quality education and 
skills development at scale and speed. Different pieces of news about education 
----------------Page (2) Break----------------
systems in Africa popped up last week. In South Africa, a pioneer private university 
was announced—until October 2025, private higher-education institutions could not 
be called “universities.” In Zimbabwe and Kenya, new initiatives to expand internet 
access in schools were launched. All of this is positive, but economic success and 
social stability are far from guaranteed, as education alone is not enough. 
Skills must evolve alongside economies, or societies risk producing trained people 
with no jobs to absorb them locally. Until now, well-trained people who could not 
find  jobs in local markets often looked for opportunities abroad–this is the classical 
brain drain problem–but things are changing. In today’s tense and troubled world, 
doors in advanced economies are closing to migrants and, more importantly, as AI 
and robotics advance, hundreds of millions of jobs will disappear globally, and 
those well-trained people and shopfloor   workers from emerging nations may no 
longer be needed in advanced economies or even in their local markets. A new 
dynamic is emerging, and past development paths are closing. 
Throughout history, to varying degrees, investments in education have paid 
off—and I firmly believe they will continue to—but the scenario is dramatically 
changing in the AI age, the window of opportunity for economies to catch up is 
narrowing and there is an absolute need for novel strategies. Countries coming 
from behind need to simultaneously accelerate talent development, skilling and 
upskilling to unprecedented speed and levels and with a focus on new skills—this 
requires massive resources—and bet heavily on entrepreneurship. The challenge is 
tremendous. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
When I visited Kenya not long ago, what struck me most was the sheer number of 
young people in public spaces on weekends: filming TikTok dances, creating 
content, rollerskating, hanging out with friends, just being there. There was energy 
and creativity, but also emptiness and a waste of human potential: 67% of Kenyans 
----------------Page (3) Break----------------
aged 15–34 are unemployed, many of them with a college education. Opportunities 
were not there, and I heard young Kenyans voicing their discontent with that reality. 
Young people in emerging and least developed economies are between a rock and a 
hard place. There are three overlapping realities: the skills young people acquire 
through education are not needed in the economy, either because they are below 
the level the market requires or because the market itself remains underdeveloped 
and cannot absorb those coming out of educational institutions; graduates cannot 
access global job markets due to immigration and labor regulations or the lack of 
skills required in more advanced economies; and jobs are disappearing globally. 
In the past, economies and societies had more time to adjust. That is no longer the 
case. Initiatives like the ones mentioned here need to scale 100×, maybe 1,000×, 
and they need completely updated content. A major shift in curricula, instructional 
approaches, education technology and scale is a must, not just in Africa. So the real 
question is: how can nations pull this off? Ideas? Examples? 
 To Keep An Eye On 
● The Prime Minister of Finland visits China (Feb 25-28, Beijing): After a week of 
turmoil in the Atlantic Alliance, the PM of Finland, Petteri Orpo, goes to China 
and is slated to meet President Xi in Beiing. Will we see any signals emerging? 
● Presidential elections in Costa Rica (Feb 1, Costa Rica): Costa Rica goes to 
the polls amid economic pressures and voter fragmentation. The result may 
signal how stable democracies in Central America are responding to social 
discontent and political polarization. 
● Milano–Cortina Winter Olympics 2026 (Feb 6–22, Italy) Beyond sports, the 
Games will be a stress test for large-scale infrastructure delivery, public 
spending discipline, and Italy’s ability to execute complex, multi-city projects 
on a global stage.

Weekly Snapshot - Jan 18, 2026 
 
 Global politics has a new playbook 
↳ Why it matters 
Global alliances are being reshuffled   at a speed we have never seen before. What 
used to sound like fringe speculation such as the potential unravelling of the 
European Union is now openly debated in mainstream political and media circles. 
And this matters because the EU has been one of the most successful peace and 
integration projects in modern history, inspiring similar regional blocs from Asia to 
Mercosur. 
----------------Page (5) Break----------------
At the same time, geopolitics is no longer played slowly, behind closed doors, or 
strictly through institutions. It looks more like poker and chess being played 
simultaneously and in real time. The Canadian Prime Minister travels to Beijing while 
slashing tariffs on Chinese EVs, signaling a recalibration of ties with China. Shortly 
after, during a stop in Doha, he receives a personal invitation from President Trump 
to join discussions around Gaza. To close the day on Saturday, the U.S. president 
announced new tariffs on European allies “until they come to the negotiating table to 
sell Greenland.” 
The common thread is clear. Traditional diplomatic playbooks, protocols, and 
alliances are being bypassed, bent, disrupted and rewritten, all at the same time. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
What we are witnessing is not just a geopolitical transition, but a structural 
breakdown. International politics today is increasingly person to person, leader to 
leader, rather than institution to institution. Engagement has overtaken frameworks. 
Speed has overtaken process. 
The consequence is unsettling. News we read today may become irrelevant 
tomorrow, reframed the day after, or dismissed as misinformation soon after that. 
The system is moving faster than our ability to interpret it. And more importantly, we 
do not yet have the institutions, governance models, or leadership training systems 
to operate in this environment. 
This feels like the early days of a new type of statecraft, or perhaps a refreshed form 
of real-power statecraft. One where unpredictability is the norm and adaptability is 
the core skill. We are only at the beginning, and the real challenge will be preparing a 
new generation of leaders who can function in a world where structures lag reality. 
When global politics has a new playbook, everybody needs to get ready for a new 
game.

 Markets alone will not solve for mosquitoes 
↳ Why it matters 
Every year, mosquito-borne diseases like dengue, zika and chikungunya cost the 
world about $100 billion. The burden falls disproportionately on emerging 
economies in the Southern hemisphere, where tropical climates prevail, economies 
are less developed than in the richer North, health systems are weaker and the social 
impact is far more dramatic. It is in this context that the recent dramatic reduction of 
dengue cases in Brazil, by more than 75%, is particularly relevant. 
Reducing the burden of dengue—and other diseases—is not just a health win. It frees 
up public resources, strengthens economies, improves quality of life and can create 
new avenues for growth. There is a second layer that matters just as much. At a time 
when science is increasingly politicized and basic public health principles are openly 
questioned, this case sends a powerful signal: science works and can deliver 
real-world impact at scale. Finally, this reframes public health as a fundamental 
investment. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Among other things, Brazil is manufacturing and releasing mosquitoes infected with 
Wolbachia bacteria to curb disease transmission. What started as a local scientific   
effort is now expanding and inspiring similar programs worldwide through the World 
Mosquito Program. The scientist behind the initiative was named by Nature as one 
----------------Page (7) Break----------------
of the 10 most influential in the world in 2025. This is impact-oriented innovation 
applied to a complex societal problem. 
The lesson here is bigger than mosquitoes. Talent exists everywhere. What often 
lacks in emerging nations are stable institutional frameworks and economic 
environments, long-term funding, entrepreneurial pathways and the ambition to scale 
solutions beyond pilots. Yes, resources matter. But ambition, governance and 
institutional trust matter just as much. And yes, governments create markets and 
can help accelerate innovation too. 
Markets alone will not solve the mosquito problem. If you think they will, answer this: 
who, if not the public sector, would pay for the manufacturing and release of 
mosquitoes? It is a systemic challenge that requires public intervention. Ignore this 
basic reality and the bill comes later, with interest, for all of us to pay. According to a 
Brazilian government agency, the expectation is that for every $1 invested in the 
Wolbachia program, government savings in medicines, hospitalizations and 
treatments overall will range between $43.45 and $549.13. Not bad, right?

 REMs mining goes ever deeper, on all fronts 
↳ Why it matters 
This past week, Japan launched the world’s first deep-sea trial to lift rare earth mud 
from 6 km below the seabed. Rare earth minerals (REMs) sit quietly at the core of 
modern life, and the Japanese economy depends on them. Electronics, digital 
----------------Page (8) Break----------------
infrastructure, automation, clean energy and defense systems — almost everything 
that defines  today’s economy relies on them. You would not be reading this on an 
electronic device without REMs, period. 
The REMs market is surprisingly small. For instance, Chinese REM exports to the 
United States amounted to about $170 million in 2024. Given the size of the U.S. 
economy, this is pocket change. But the importance of REMs is not about their price 
or the size of the market. It is about everything that would not exist without them. A 
disruption in REM supply to advanced economies like Japan or the U.S. would not 
cause losses in the tens or hundreds of millions, but would instead wipe out trillions 
of dollars in economic value — think of all the chips, computers, satellites, rockets 
and smartphones that would not be manufactured. 
This is not a problem that free markets can solve on their own. It is a strategic 
challenge that requires coordination, and that is where governments must step in. 
Small markets do not naturally attract the long-term investments needed to secure 
critical supply chains. This is precisely why the U.S., assuming markets alone would 
handle the issue, became so dependent on China. The contrast is stark. China 
engineered its dominance by aligning strategic foresight, state power, industrial 
policy and long-term planning. Much of the West left the future to market forces. 
Japan’s move to become the first country to mine rare earths from the deep sea is 
therefore not just about resources. It is also about governance models. About which 
systems can create durable competitive advantages in a world where speed and 
coordination are essential. And yes, we are talking about a government-backed 
project. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Japan is an island nation, geographically close to China, an advanced economy 
deeply embedded in global supply chains and exposed in a fragmented world. 
Deep-sea mining is a bold attempt to reclaim strategic autonomy. But it comes with 
----------------Page (9) Break----------------
uncomfortable questions. We are pushing into fragile, poorly understood 
ecosystems. The environmental consequences of deep-sea extraction remain largely 
unknown. On a weakened planet, we are once again expanding into new frontiers 
without fully understanding the cost. This echoes earlier chapters of industrial 
progress, from deforestation to biodiversity loss, now extended beneath the ocean 
surface. 
There are alternatives in the REMs play. Such minerals exist in Africa, Australia and 
Latin America. But mining alone is not enough. Refining  is where real power sits, and 
this is where China still holds a decisive advantage. Building refining capacity takes 
time, technology and sustained political will. I have heard policymakers openly 
question whether it would take years or even a decade to catch up. This is the real 
dilemma. Do countries try to negotiate their way out of dependency? Or do they 
invest, patiently and expensively, in building new technological capabilities? Only a 
handful of nations can afford to answer that question in a way that truly shifts the 
balance. 
Japan is choosing action. I admire that, as I have always admired Japanese society 
for its astonishing achievements, capabilities, resilience, perfectionist drive and 
politeness. But I also hope this time is different in relation to the country’s 
relationship with the environment — think of whales, for instance. Different from the 
quiet destruction that often accompanies strategic ambition across the world. The 
deep sea is not an empty space, it is full of life. There are so many things we don't 
know, and the choices being made will echo far beyond minerals.

The world has changed! 
It's 2026 and the world has changed. Have you noticed? 
The post–WWII order is crumbling (wasn’t it already, and we are now just seeing it?). 
Technology continues to accelerate and capital to concentrate. Social upheaval and 
youth protests are spreading globally. Truth has eroded in the age of AI. Uncertainty 
is building. Rules are being rewritten in real time. New and unusual alliances are 
forming. And only a few in the world can read the signals. 
Wow. That is a lot, isn’t it? Feeling overwhelmed? Get ready for what comes next. 
2026 has the potential to be one of those years remembered by history. It feels like 
1848, 1938, 1968... doesn’t it? Or... horse meets tiger and monkey squared. Things 
will never be the same again.

 Regimes are trembling 
↳ Why it matters 
From Caracas to Tehran to Havana, tension is in the air. We have all seen in the news 
the abduction of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela. Cuba has been suffering for decades 
and will suffer even more in the aftermath of the strikes in Venezuela. We are now 
seeing in real time, as I write: across Iran, people are on the streets protesting, 
fighting, dying. The regimes in these three countries are trembling. 
What these cases have in common is striking: they are increasingly alone. No one is 
coming to rescue them. In this new world order, self-reliance is essential. And these 
are three failing economies, failing their populations. Pressure comes from within 
and, there's no secret, from the outside — from sanctions imposed by the U.S. and 
Europe to military threats and interventions. But there is another layer to this story 
and, in the end, though, it all comes back to failing institutional and economic 
models, as the participation of bazaar merchants in the protests in Iran suggest. 
Beyond the countries in question, the realization that self-reliance matters is likely to 
drive a new wave of defense investment across the world. In most cases, this will be 
a simple waste of money, as asymmetries are gigantic and only a handful of 
countries can realistically think about confronting the big powers. 
----------------Page (12) Break----------------
↳ My thoughts on it 
In one of my previous lives, I had the chance to visit Havana, Caracas and Tehran. My 
first impression in Havana was simple and powerful: this place lacks color. Caracas, 
where I have been many times, always felt tough — a city marked by violence in daily 
interactions, where trust sits at the very bottom of society. Tehran was different. My 
visit was short, but walking through commercial areas and bazaars, it felt more open 
than I expected. At the same time, I constantly had the sensation (sensation?) of 
being watched. 
In all three places, I had the same underlying impression: they could be very different. 
They could be much better. I have met and world with many people from these 
countries. I have Iranian-American friends who are incredibly smart, entrepreneurial 
and creative. What Persian civilization contributed over millennia — in science, 
technology, arts, literature and poetry — is extraordinary. Creativity and human 
potential are there. 
But the world has changed. In the new global order taking shape, it will be 
increasingly difficult  for countries to confront major regional powers if they lack 
economic strength and internal resilience. When basic economic principles are 
broken, everything else becomes a non-starter, and economies directly controlled by 
the military are doomed to fail. Make your bets and get ready for the shake-up.

 Listening is learning (not just for humans) 
----------------Page (13) Break----------------
↳ Why it matters 
A groundbreaking study published in Science this past week reveals that a rare group 
of dogs, dubbed Gifted Word Learners (GWLs) — think border collies, shepherds, 
labradors, mini schnauzers — can acquire names for objects simply by overhearing 
human conversations, without being directly addressed. Much like 18- to 
23-month-old human infants, these dogs successfully learned new object labels both 
when owners spoke to them and when they merely eavesdropped on conversations 
about the objects. In controlled tests, each label was heard for only a few minutes, 
yet the dogs reliably retrieved the correct toy by name afterward. 
This challenges long-held assumptions that learning from overheard speech is 
uniquely human. It suggests that some non-human animals share cognitive 
mechanisms for social word learning, pointing to deeper continuities between 
human and animal cognition than we previously assumed. It is another signal that 
we are closer to animals than many believed in the past — that our humanity is not 
detached from their animality, but connected to it through shared evolutionary roots 
of learning, communication and social understanding. The finding also underscores 
a critical point: cognitive capacities exist on a spectrum, not as a binary of “having” 
or “not having.” Gifted dogs may become powerful models for investigating the 
fundamental building blocks of communication and learning. 
But let me add a market perspective to close. The pet market is booming globally 
and is projected to grow almost 50% by the end of the decade. Imagine the potential 
for human–pet connectivity — see the comment about my personal dream below. I 
see an amazing future business opportunity. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
I need to confess: this one is personal. I discovered late in life that I truly love dogs, 
and I still miss my beloved mini-Chinouser, Lara. That is probably why this study 
struck me so deeply. 
----------------Page (14) Break----------------
We already knew that dogs can learn but this study shows that they can learn 
through passive social observation, mirroring a key stage of human language 
development. Children do not need constant instruction to acquire language. They 
listen in, scan social interactions, follow attention and gaze, and extract meaning 
from ambient speech. These dogs with exceptional vocabularies seem to do exactly 
that. That says something profound about cognition, about continuity rather than 
separation between species. 
At a time when we are witnessing rapid advances in brain–machine interfaces, here 
is my dream: I would love to connect my brain to the brains of my cats and dogs, and 
maybe others. Animals are endlessly fascinating, gentle, and emotionally rich. 
Imagine if we could communicate with them more seamlessly, beyond gestures, 
tone, or limited verbal cues. Imagine sharing meaning directly. If that future is even 
remotely possible, I want to be part of it. And if you happen to know someone 
working on that frontier, let me know. I am ready to volunteer.

 A 700 million people market emerges (hopefully) 
↳ Why it matters 
Mercosur and the European Union together represent around 700 million people. The 
free trade agreement between them, which covers roughly 90% of traded goods, 
creates the largest free trade area in the world. Having the deal signed does not 
guarantee smooth or full implementation. There are safeguards, transition periods, 
and many technical details still to be worked out. But even so, this is a major step, 
particularly after 25 years of negotiation. 
----------------Page (15) Break----------------
Beyond trade flows, the agreement strengthens ties between Europe and the Global 
South at a time when the world is fragmenting. Europe is under (a lot of) economic 
and geopolitical pressure, China has made significant   advances in Latin America and 
the United States is reasserting its influence in the Western Hemisphere. In this 
context, deeper engagement with Mercosur countries becomes strategically relevant 
for Europe. 
My take is that the biggest opportunity may not be trade itself, but foreign direct 
investment. Mercosur countries can attract European capital, while Europe can 
benefit  from cost advantages in the region, especially in energy and labor–be quick, 
AI and robots will soon change this. And at a broader level, the agreement sends a 
signal that multilateralism is still possible, even as the global system we once knew 
is gone. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The current administration in Brazil prioritized this agreement and Brazil chaired 
Mercosur until December, so there is merit to be recognized. This deal took 25 years 
to negotiate, while Brazil’s tax reform, debated for more than 35 years, was also 
finally approved in 2023. These are not changes that the average person feels 
immediately in daily life, but they are certainly relevant–the tax reform for sure, big 
time. The effects will come later. Still, in a deeply polarized and complex political 
environment, this is a display of skillful politics, domestically and across borders. 
The economic impact remains to be seen. Signing an agreement is not enough. New 
infrastructure, sustained dialogue, business ties, human resources development and 
investment mechanisms will be needed to turn potential into results. The real 
question is whether Mercosur, and Brazil in particular as its largest economy, can 
work with European partners to create new layers of cooperation that actually deliver 
outcomes. That is the challenge and the opportunity. 
----------------Page (16) Break----------------
To close: I am sure people in Brasília, Montevideo, Asunción, Buenos Aires 
(probably), Brussels, Berlin, Madrid and Rome are pleased. I am far less convinced 
that the same is true in Beijing and Washington.

Weekly Snapshot - Dec 21, 2025 
 
 Robots can dance, impress and more 
----------------Page (17) Break----------------
↳ Why it matters 
2025 started with Jensen Huang talking about robots at CES in Las Vegas. It is 
ending with 600 humanoid robots dancing in Chengdu during a live music 
performance. That arc tells you almost everything you need to know. Humanoid 
robots sit right at the intersection of AI and the physical world, and while 
performance is still uneven, the pace of progress is extraordinary. 
The real question is no longer whether demand for humanoid robots will exist, but 
when performance and price points will meet what different market segments are 
willing to adopt, which companies will succeed and which countries will dominate 
these markets. And the moment when performance and prices meet market 
requirements may come faster than many expect. Prices in China are already being 
quoted as low as US$1,200 for basic humanoid platforms. That is astonishing, and it 
immediately raises questions about sustainability, margins, long-term business 
models and national industrial strategy. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
As Elon Musk himself noted, the dancing robots in Chengdu were impressive. But the 
deeper story is not the performance, it is the industrial strategy behind it. China is 
applying the same playbook we saw in electric vehicles: dozens, sometimes 
hundreds, of companies launched at once, backed by incentives and subsidies, 
competing ferociously, driving costs down and accelerating learning curves until 
economics force consolidation. Many companies will fail. That is expected. But the 
system is designed to surface winners at speed. 
If China managed to produce roughly 70% of the world’s EVs by 2025, imagine the 
implications if it succeeds in doing something similar with humanoid robotics. This 
is not just deep tech. It is consumer-facing innovation moving fast enough to be 
visible, tangible and cultural. I was reminded of a Brazilian CEO who once told me 
she goes to China for innovation, not the U.S. What she meant was not frontier 
----------------Page (18) Break----------------
research, but the things already hitting the market and reshaping consumption. Her 
comments were about customer-facing innovation. 
Most humanoid robots may still feel experimental, even theatrical. But as an industry, 
robotics is scaling fast. Watching how countries position themselves in this race is 
essential, and it is not just China and the U.S. that are in the race. As usual, Japan is 
playing under the radar, with Toyota and other companies, and other players may 
emerge. Do not underestimate them. 2025 mattered. 2026 will matter even more.

 Is the world splitting in energy strategies? 
↳ Why it matters 
The rapid expansion of AI in 2025 came with a hidden bill. New research suggests 
that AI-related activity generated CO₂ emissions comparable to those of New York 
City and consumed water volumes on the scale of the entire global bottled water 
market. At the same time, a proposed hyperscale data center in the UK’s 
Northumberland region revealed how opaque these impacts can be: estimates 
indicate that indirect water use could be up to 50 times higher than what was 
officially reported. 
----------------Page (19) Break----------------
AI is no longer just a digital phenomenon. It is a material force with real 
environmental externalities. Data centers already represent the fastest-growing 
category of energy consumption worldwide. Around 45% of them are located in the 
United States, followed by the European Union with roughly 15%. Feeding this growth 
has become a strategic question. In parallel, 2025 saw a surge of announcements in 
the U.S. around nuclear power for AI, from small modular reactors to renewed 
interest in fusion. 
Meanwhile, China massively expanded solar and wind generation, scaled clean-tech 
manufacturing and flooded global markets with hardware, materials and systems. 
Science magazine recently named the surge in renewables the scientific   
breakthrough of 2025, noting that renewables surpassed coal as the world’s largest 
source of electricity and that solar and wind alone covered the entire growth in global 
electricity demand in the first half of the year. Most of that capacity came from 
Chinese manufacturing. 
This makes one thing clear: the AI conversation is not just about algorithms, and not 
even just about the computer chips on which algorithms run. It is about energy 
systems, industrial capacity, global trade and the ability of states to align industrial 
policy, with technology at the center, and business strategies at scale. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
What recent news about AI exposes is the environmental cost it carries, but it also 
suggests the potential emergence of two distinct energy strategies to cope with AI 
needs. In the West, and especially in the U.S., the response to AI’s energy hunger is 
increasingly nuclear-centric. In China, the biggest emitter today, the overarching 
energy focus has been to dominate clean tech across solar, wind, batteries, grids, 
materials and exports, while keeping nuclear and fusion largely out of Western 
headlines. 
----------------Page (20) Break----------------
That raises some deep questions. Has the U.S. effectively ceded leadership in clean 
tech manufacturing? And what is China doing in nuclear, small reactors and fusion 
that we are not seeing or not discussing? The Chinese model is playing out in full 
view: coordinated industrial policy, subsidies, intense internal competition, global 
market focus and relentless scaling. It worked for EVs. It is now shaping global clean 
energy. 
The U.S. has clearly awakened to this reality and is experimenting with new policy 
tools under the Trump administration. But the real elephant in the room is Europe. Is 
Europe equipped to play this game at all? Can it position itself between the U.S. and 
China with a coherent energy, industrial and AI strategy? Or is the European model, 
as it stands, simply crumbling under pressure? 
One thing I will be watching closely in 2026 is whether anything genuinely new 
emerges from Europe. Because in a world where AI, energy and electrification   are 
converging, sitting on the sidelines is no longer an option.

 China runs another large-scale economic 
experiment 
↳ Why it matters 
----------------Page (21) Break----------------
Deng Xiaoping and Rajiv Gandhi allegedly coined the expression “the century of 
Asia.” In 2025, 60% of global growth came from Asia. As anticipated at the beginning 
of the year, the Chinese government launched the rules for the new economic regime 
for Hainan. Hainan is the southern part of China, a tropical island. If it were an 
independent country, it would be the 70th largest economy in the world. 
What China has done is impressive, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of 
poverty and advancing its scientific   and industrial economy. But this has not come 
without challenges. We have all read about the importance the Chinese government 
places on energizing the domestic market. But they have not succeeded yet. And, as 
expected, growth has slowed. China still needs to grow. 
So how can growth be sustained in China? It is impossible to replicate the Chinese 
model. But what China is doing in Hainan is creating a new gateway to China. And in 
some sense, this is a major experiment, one that is only possible in China. But it will 
force other countries to reposition themselves and, once again, create a new 
economic space. 
Very importantly, what has been done is not only about trade in goods and services. 
There is also, and for some time now, a very important digital component. 
Companies and people in Hainan can operate outside the Great Firewall. The 
meaning and scale of this are even greater. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
China has a unique reality, unique possibilities and unique challenges. It can 
generate large-scale experiments like the one in Hainan. China has many resorts and 
beaches, but the implementation of this new free trade economic regime is a major 
experiment. Other countries cannot even think about doing this. 
A hypothesis that has circulated for a long time is the “China peak” hypothesis, the 
idea that China’s economy has already peaked. There are major challenges in terms 
----------------Page (22) Break----------------
of economic dynamics, internal growth, the health of the banking system, questions 
around real estate bubbles and, above all, China’s ability to continue growing. 
Population decline is at the center of this. 
With Hainan, China is forcing other countries to change and reposition themselves–I 
strongly encourage everyone to read Alex Lin’s analysis; follow the links below for 
that. But the bigger question is whether China, by generating large-scale 
experiments, will be able to change some basic and fundamental dynamics, such as 
those related to population and demographic trends. That remains to be seen. 
As we close the first quarter of the 21st century, there is still a long road ahead. And 
Asia will be at the center of many of the developments we will see for the rest of the 
century. We all should know much more about Asia and China than we do today. By 
the way... I’ve never been to Hainan, have you?

 Between a rock and a hard place 
↳ Why it matters 
In today’s world, balancing relationships with the two big powers is not easy. 
Geography matters, and for Mexico and Canada, more than for most others, dancing 
with the U.S. is destiny. Both are deeply tied to the United States, but each is 
adjusting its strategy in response to a more fragmented and complex global 
landscape. Both are in motion, flexing their capabilities, testing limits, experimenting 
and generating lessons. 
Mexico’s decision to raise tariffs on Chinese and other Asian imports is more than a 
trade move. It signals alignment with U.S. concerns over supply chains and industrial 
competition, reinforced by visible improvements in security and a stronger state 
response to organized crime — and Batman is a great nickname, isn’t it? Together, 
these steps help stabilize and strengthen Mexico’s relationship with Washington. 
Canada is taking a different route. It wants to expand exports and reduce 
dependence on the U.S. by deepening ties with Asia, including China, while still 
----------------Page (24) Break----------------
preserving a functional and trusted relationship with its southern neighbor. Managing 
both at once is complex and can be risky. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
As I’ve written before, strategic capabilities are in short supply across the world. 
Dealing with internal challenges while positioning a country in a turbulent global 
system demands coordination, experience, political clarity and resources. Mexico 
and Canada illustrate both the possibilities and the limits of this balancing act. 
Something that clearly stands out is a shift away from ideology toward pragmatism. 
For countries caught between great powers, this is less about picking sides and 
more about building the capacity to navigate uncertainty and a fussy environment. 
Others should watch closely and learn.

 2025 was the AI year, get ready for what will come 
next 
↳ Why it matters 
This week, TIME named “The Architects of AI” as its 2025 Person of the Year, not a 
single individual, but the engineers, researchers and executives shaping the AI 
revolution. It is a symbolic but powerful signal: artificial intelligence is not a 
supporting actor in economic and geopolitical narratives. It is the protagonist and 
the storyline itself. From productivity gains and scientific   breakthroughs to labor 
displacement and power concentration, AI is increasingly influencing how 
----------------Page (25) Break----------------
economies grow, how companies compete and how governments think about 
regulation, security and sovereignty. 
The obvious implications are that (1) AI is and will be everywhere — we will soon 
have two types of companies: those that use AI and those that closed their doors — 
and (2) all nations, cities and governments need practical AI strategies, not just loose 
papers and vague declarations. Beyond that, and very importantly, the “AI age” also 
signals a major shift of power from nation-states to industry, like never before, not 
just in AI. Think of SpaceX and space, for instance. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Two weeks ago, I wrote here about the U.S. Genesis Mission, highlighting the central 
role that AI has in that and the U.S. Government ambitions related to it. The scale of 
today’s AI push is unprecedented, specially when compared to past endeavors and 
technology shifts. At their peaks, the Manhattan Project absorbed about 0.4% of U.S. 
GDP and Apollo about 0.8%. Investments in AI in 2025 alone exceeded 1.3%. Nothing 
in modern history compares to the volume of capital, infrastructure, energy and 
talent now flowing into AI worldwide. And I bet this is not just in the U.S. 
An MIT report recently described this AI moment as an “iceberg,” when we think 
about the impacts on the economy. What we see today is only the tip. Beneath the 
surface, AI will have much deeper impacts on jobs, economic structures and 
societies. If 2025 was the year of AI, the years ahead will be about its consequences. 
Productivity gains are already impressive and, from personal experience, what AI can 
do today is astonishing. But disruption is coming at scale. Many people will be 
surprised, many will lose their jobs and our institutions are not ready. In the U.S., only 
43% of young people have a positive view of capitalism. Globally, Gen Z protests are 
rising, like we saw this past week in Bulgaria. When rapid technological change 
meets social fragility, tensions grow. AI will create enormous value, but it will also 
test societies in ways we may not be prepared for.

 Chile makes a right turn 
↳ Why it matters 
Latin America has the highest cost of security as a share of GDP in the world, and 
Chile’s recent election put that reality front and center. Crime and migration 
dominated the campaign. With Venezuela collapsing and economies lagging behind 
in parts of the region, such as Bolivia, Chile has seen a dramatic surge in migration: 
the migrant population is rising and the number of undocumented migrants has 
grown tenfold in just five years. That is a massive shock for any society. 
The election result marks a clear shift to the right, echoing broader regional trends 
after Milei’s election in Argentina, where tougher stances on security are gaining 
traction while the left struggles to articulate credible answers. This will not stop with 
Chile. Security will shape politics across Latin America, including Brazil’s 2026 
election. Can the left have an answer to the security crisis? 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Chile is a strikingly beautiful country, a thin ribbon between the Andes and the 
Pacific,  with Santiago framed by mountains and a dynamic business district, but with 
deep regional disparities. It has made real progress, reaching a GDP per capita of 
roughly $17–18k, yet inequality remains high and growth has slowed. Those 
tensions erupted in the 2019 protests and later in a failed constitutional reform, 
which also exposed the limits of identity-driven politics detached from economic 
----------------Page (27) Break----------------
realities. Kast, the president-elect, promises fiscal cuts without sacrificing   social 
progress, an ambitious balance that remains untested. 
Crime, while rising sharply in the north, is still lower than in much of the region, a 
reminder of how grim Latin America’s baseline has become — for comparison, 
murder rates in northern Chile are below the Brazilian average, which, by the way, has 
reached its lowest point in 11 years. Enormous resources continue to be absorbed 
by the fight against drugs, even as the war on drugs has clearly failed across the 
continent. Demand persists, supply adapts and societies pay the price. 
Chile’s economy still depends heavily on copper, nearly 60% of exports, a blessing as 
global demand surges but also a constraint. Despite strong talent and investment in 
science, Chile has not become a global innovation powerhouse. What is holding it 
back? That question matters not just for Chile, but for a region searching for a way to 
deliver security, opportunity and dignity at the same time.

 Rethinking rocket science 
↳ Why it matters 
The space economy is growing fast and, according to McKinsey, it will reach $1.8 
trillion per year by 2035. SpaceX has transformed the economics of launch, and it is 
slated to do it again with the Heavy. But a lot more is needed. Space is also getting 
crowded and we will need to launch many things into space, and we will need to 
make and do many things in space. We need to grow food, build things, manufacture, 
store data, process data and so on. And this means we will need a diversity of 
solutions, not just one type of solution. 
With Moonshot Space coming out of stealth mode this past week, it adds to the cast 
of companies experimenting with alternative launch systems. As reported, they will 
use electromagnetism to accelerate and launch payloads into space. But not all 
types of payloads, especially those less sensitive to acceleration and impact, like 
supplies, raw materials, components and parts, but not sophisticated electronics 
such as satellites. 
This development is also relevant because it is a clear spinoff of Israel’s defense 
investments. The CEO was a former key leader in the Iron Dome project, the 
tremendously successful air defense system Israel put in place to protect the 
country from threats flying in from hostile neighbors. All combined, this is a big 
display of the opportunity for alternative launch systems, the spinoffs from Israel’s 
defense programs and Israel’s amazing entrepreneurship drive. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
----------------Page (29) Break----------------
At Seldor Capital, we invested in a tremendously efficient and innovative Hyperloop 
company, Swisspod. That company has a brilliant team and they just had a very 
successful Hyperloop Day in Pueblo, Colorado. But you may be thinking what a 
space tech fund was doing investing in Hyperloop, right? Well, there are two 
answers. The first is that Hyperloop is a super cool technology, and they have a 
tremendously creative, technically sound and highly effective team. The other 
answer is that we envisioned the type of thing that Moonshot Space aims to do. We 
see the need for diverse solutions to enable the space economy, including the 
opportunity for alternative launch systems to put stuff into space. 
But there is something else here. An important part of the economic rationale for 
Moonshot Space is that when a rocket is launched, the payload is actually a tiny 
fraction of the weight, the mass that is accelerated into space. This means we use a 
lot of energy to move things just to move a small quantity of materials up there, so 
efficiency is very low. This reminds me of another mobility solution that most people 
around the world have never heard about: the AeroMobile or AeroM system, which is 
a wind-propelled rail system. This means that train wagons do not have drivetrains, 
batteries or engines. The propulsion system is outside the vehicle, and this makes 
the whole system much more efficient because you do not need to waste energy to 
accelerate dead weight, something you do not really need to move. The same logic 
applies to the launch system that Moonshot Space is building. It is incredibly 
interesting to see how Earth mobility systems are conceptually connected to what 
they are doing, isn’t it? 
It is very interesting to see, and it will be very interesting to follow what comes next 
with Moonshot Space and others. And for you all on Earth, stay tuned on Swisspod 
and Aerom.

 Nature is disappearing 
↳ Why it matters 
A recent study published in Nature estimates that 80% of mammal biomass in Africa 
has already vanished. Another study, tracking over 5,000 vertebrate species, shows a 
73% decline in their populations between 1970 and 2020. That’s almost three out of 
every four animals — gone. These are not abstract numbers. We are losing things we 
don’t even know exist. Insects. Plant species. Fungi. Life forms that have evolved 
over millions of years are disappearing silently. Every extinction is a lost opportunity 
— for food, for medicine, for inspiration, for balance. 
But this is more than biodiversity. We are dismantling the infrastructure of life on 
Earth. Forests, soils, rivers, wetlands, oceans — they are not just “nature.” They are 
our food system, our climate regulation, our water supply, our health, our prosperity. 
These ecosystems provide services that we depend on every single day. Without 
them, everything else collapses. And it’s also personal. To some of us–like me, 
nature is sacred. It is not just resource — it is beauty, balance, and existence itself. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
I remember going to the movies as a kid in the 1970s, watching wide-eyed as lions 
roamed the savannas of Africa and whales leapt across the screen. I remember that 
sense of wonder. Children love animals. They love forests and rivers and birds and 
turtles. So when is it that we lose that? At what age does death and destruction 
become normal? When do we stop marveling at life and start accepting its 
disappearance as inevitable? 
There’s something deeply broken when we speak of GDP growth while forests burn, 
or when we talk about innovation while species vanish forever. Because ultimately, 
----------------Page (31) Break----------------
nature is not “out there.” It is us. That’s not just a philosophical question. If we 
normalize the collapse of nature, we lose more than species — we lose our humanity.

 Give peace a chance 
↳ Why it matters 
Pope Leo’s visit to Lebanon last week is not just a gesture — it is a powerful bet on 
reconciliation. Lebanon has suffered immensely. From the civil war to Hezbollah’s 
conflicts  with Israel, the country’s economy has collapsed, poverty has soared and 
its society was brought to its knees. From a golden age in the 1960s and a beautiful 
past, Lebanon became a symbol of despair with a crumbling economy, a 
non-existent internal financial market, a large diaspora and remittances 
corresponding to more than 50% of GDP. 
Beirut has always been a crossroads where cultures, religions, people and tribes 
meet. For far too long, the Middle East has been shaken by violence. And I really 
mean for far too long. Waves of invasions from the East and the West — from every 
side — have defined  the region’s history for millennia. And Lebanon can only be 
understood within a broader regional context, and the region only within a broader 
global one. 
The Levant is one of the cradles of Western civilization. If Lebanon can be fixed, if its 
society can heal and connections be mended, maybe it can offer a template for other 
places in the world. 
----------------Page (32) Break----------------
↳ My thoughts on it 
Beirut was one of the most beautiful cities on Earth. Before the civil war, it was. 
Going there after the war was something else entirely. I had never seen a city where 
the buildings looked like Swiss cheese — walls torn by bullets and bombs. And that 
was 20 years after the war had ended. But the geography is stunning, and the people 
are extraordinary. I have many Lebanese (and Lebanese Brazilian, Lebanese 
American, etc.) friends, and I admire them deeply — their resilience, their culture, 
their warmth. 
The complexity of that society is gigantic and fascinating. I remember sitting in a 
hotel lobby in Beirut and seeing the diversity of people coming and going, feeling like 
I had walked into a James Bond movie. People in corners wearing business, military, 
religious and ethnic attire, intense conversations, quiet signals, excitement and 
mistery — something was in the air. 
Maybe Pope Leo’s visit is the spark that reminds us all that peace is a process that 
requires outreach, not a miracle. Good signals are popping up, such as the 
conversations with Israel moving forward. It is never too late for hope. And it is never 
too late for the Pope.

Weekly Snapshot - Nov 30, 2025 
 
 Turbulent times require bold approaches. 
↳ Why it matters 
The White House just announced Genesis Mission, a sweeping national initiative that 
will leverage capabilities, datasets and resources — for example, the supercomputers 
owned and operated by the U.S. national labs — to accelerate breakthroughs in 
biotechnology, advanced energy, critical materials, advanced manufacturing, 
semiconductors, next-generation quantum computing and beyond. It is not a single 
program, it is a whole-of-government effort designed to align federal agencies, 
industry, academia and civil society around long-term innovation goals. More 
importantly, from a conceptual standpoint, it is designed to surf the “AI as a 
scientist” (and engineer) trend I have commented on in this Snapshot on past 
occasions. 
Throughout history, the U.S. has shown its ability to mobilize resources at scale to 
address major challenges — think of the Manhattan Project, the Apollo Program, 
DARPA’s moonshots and others. Genesis is a national mission to accelerate science 
through artificial intelligence and has a fundamental characteristic: it is a program 
with massive resources but not a massive budget per se. Intrigued? Genesis will 
connect, coordinate, leverage and create value from resources that, for the most 
part, are already there — existing datasets, the supercomputers that the national labs 
----------------Page (34) Break----------------
have, and scientific   and innovation capabilities distributed across government 
agencies, universities and industry. This highlights two fundamental things at the 
same time: the importance of bold projects and the imperative, along with the 
opportunities to unleash value creation and impact, of coordinating initiatives and 
resources. Other countries should learn from that, whatever the results are. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
From the pyramids, the Wall of China, and the road and water systems in the Roman 
Empire to the massive technology projects of the 20th and 21st centuries, broad, 
ambitious and transformational technology initiatives drive economic change, 
launch new industries and push economies and humanity into the future. They act as 
focusing mechanisms, compress time, concentrate talent and unlock invention that 
markets alone would take decades to reach. We extensively reviewed 
transformational technology projects and made the case for them in the GFCC — 
follow the links below for the Leveraging Extreme Innovation report about that. 
But transformational technology projects require three things: resources, leadership 
and coordination. Their importance can hardly be overemphasized, and I certainly 
have my own country in mind when I make this comment. Bold initiatives need to be 
coordinated at or from — or in close coordination with — the center of power, the 
prime minister or the president's office. In the U.S., the DoE is leading the initiative in 
coordination with the White House Office  of Science and Technology Policy. 
Importantly, countries need leadership (yes, I am repeating this), vision and 
institutional infrastructures to enable all of that. 
Let's think about the practicalities of this and the possibilities of the U.S. model 
being replicated in other environments (the model, not the resources). To catalyze 
thinking, I will leave you with a few questions. We are living in the digital era, right? So 
which countries in the world have a data strategy for government-funded research? 
Which countries have directories to standardize data collection, storage and 
----------------Page (35) Break----------------
treatment of research endeavors and results? Just think about it. And tell me if 
anyone comes to your mind.

 New partnerships are emerging in the world 
↳ Why it matters 
This past week, Kazakhstan and the UAE announced a deeper strategic partnership 
focused on high-tech cooperation, investment and long-term industrial development. 
On the surface, it may look like an extended regional economic story, but it is more 
than that. 
Geographically, Kazakhstan sits at the crossroads of Russia, China and India. That is 
a part of the world that has shaped global trade for thousands of years, from the Silk 
Road to today’s energy and logistics corridors. Add the U.S. to the equation and, 
metaphorically, Kazakhstan is at an even more complex crossroad. Positioning the 
country among all these big players in what the media in Astana calls a “multi-vector 
policy” is not a trivial task. Only a handful of countries can aim to strike a balance. 
Which are those? 
One of the first countries that comes to my mind because of its strategic capabilities 
and its ability to successfully balance relationships with the so-called West, China 
and Russia is the UAE. But the UAE has also become a global investment 
powerhouse, deploying capital with long-term strategic intent far beyond the Middle 
East. Think of Mubadala’s footprint in Brazil or ADQ’s growing influence across Asia 
----------------Page (36) Break----------------
and Africa. When the UAE invests, it is rarely transactional, it is part of a broader 
blueprint to access critical resources, form long-term bonds and shape the industries 
and technologies of the future. 
If Kazakhstan needs a template to successfully navigate the complexities of today's 
world, the UAE can be a good one. There is a lot of space for institutional learning. 
Bonus track: access to capital, always important, especially for a country in between 
with about $10,000 of GDP per capita, and a shared ambition to move from a natural 
resources-based economy to the innovation economy. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
I’ve seen innovation on the ground in Kazakhstan, and it surprised me. Some of the 
most interesting models I’ve encountered in the world for driving innovation outside 
traditional sectors like mining were built there, combining the demand for hardware 
and software with global research, industry and tech investment partnerships. A 
good friend tells me the most “digital” construction and real estate company he has 
seen in the whole world is there. 
The UAE accumulated wealth and is using it to construct the foundations of a future 
economy driven by technology and innovation, not oil. It has also become a major 
global business hub, from finance to entertainment (think of the amusement parks in

In spite of the differences in wealth and the challenges each nation faces, it is

with different levels of resource allocation, both nations are striving to advance their 
innovation capabilities. One is extending its strategic reach, and the other needs a

template and partners to avoid being boxed by the big powers. While most of the 
world is not paying attention, a ramification  of a new, ideology-agnostic and 
pragmatic global axis may be shaping up. Never forget: many (most?) of the big 
business opportunities in the world may be in our blindspots.

 Nuclear fusion meets biology in the global South 
↳ Why it matters 
While much of the global conversation on energy transition focuses on innovative 
hardware and software solutions to enable advanced nuclear, next-gen solar, 
grid-scale batteries and hydrogen, biomass remains a mature, low-cost and scalable 
technology to produce renewable energy. This is particularly relevant for countries 
with abundant organic material, agricultural waste or favorable climates. In 
Southeast Asia, recent debates suggest that biomass-based energy generation may 
double in the years to come, with a priority focus on industry utilization. 
And in a world hungry for energy, with climate goals increasingly difficult  to reach, 
biomass offers an alternative and complementary pathway to other emerging 
technologies and an avenue of opportunities that is mostly open for countries in the 
southern part of the globe. With land, water, sunlight and chlorophyll, they have an 
advantage in photosynthesis capacity. For those countries, biomass and bioenergy 
can combine the unique advantages given by location and natural resources with the 
development of indigenous technology, agricultural and mnufacturing capabilities, 
business and whole industry sectors, as Brazil has done in the case of ethanol and 
biodiesel. Countries in the South do not need to follow the paths chosen by those in 
----------------Page (38) Break----------------
the North and, in doing so, they can develop competitive advantages. The window of 
opportunity, however, will not stay open forever and timing will be critical. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The best energy-storage technology humanity has ever seen is photosynthesis. The 
energy coming from the sun — originating via a nuclear fusion process — is 
transformed into glucose and stored in biomass through a process that captures and 
stores carbon. And the regions with the greatest natural endowment for this are 
mostly in the southern part of the planet — Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa. 
The potential for everything biomass-related is immense in those areas. 
Brazil is the undisputed champion of bioenergy in the world, both because of the 
unparalleled total capacity that plants in the country have to absorb carbon dioxide 
from the atmosphere through photosynthesis to produce energy and because of the 
investments the country made to create and consolidate a vigorous bioenergy 
industry sector. In the 1970s, without money to import oil, it built an entire ethanol 
industry from scratch. For decades, Brazilian cars ran on ethanol and a complete 
biomanufacturing ecosystem emerged. 
However, Brazil never fully internationalized its biofuels industry as it could. But it 
still can, especially when modern biotechnology unlocks even more value from 
biomass and new technologies such as those to manufacture hydrogen from ethanol 
emerge and mature. There is also enormous potential for global connections and 
cross-border deals, as companies such as Cemvita, Be8 and Sumitomo illustrate, 
connecting industrial processes with biological innovation to turn biomass into 
high-value products taken to global markets. This should also be an inspiring case 
for Malaysia, Indonesia and others.

 A key player in today's global chess 
↳ Why it matters 
Last Tuesday, the White House unveiled a sweeping framework to deepen 
U.S.–Saudi cooperation across defense, energy, technology and investment. Crown 
Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) added fuel to this by confirming  plans for the 
Kingdom to invest up to $1 trillion in the United States. This is a lot of money, even in 
and for the U.S. Riyadh wants to anchor its Vision 2030 transformation to the world’s 
most dynamic innovation and financial ecosystem, while Washington wants access 
to Saudi Arabia's capital and to bring it closer to its sphere at a moment of 
intensifying global competition. But there is more behind the scenes. 
----------------Page (40) Break----------------
In a shifting global landscape, with uncertainty about the long-term U.S. debt 
trajectory and pressure on the U.S. dollar as a global currency, especially as China 
could accelerate the sale of U.S. bonds, it is critical to count on Middle Eastern 
countries to hold these assets. But there is more. Nations in the Middle East, 
particularly the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Israel, have become in different ways central 
players in the future of advanced technologies. Peace in the region is essential not 
only to relieve suffering and stop the carnage but also to accelerate its rise as a key 
engine of the global economy and the future of technology. The emerging 
U.S.–Saudi agreement, or its current expression of intent, shows how important 
Middle Eastern countries have become for the future of the global economy and 
technology. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The trillion-dollar commitment changes the psychology of the U.S.–Saudi 
relationship. It turns Riyadh into one of the most significant   foreign investors in U.S. 
strategic industries and gives Saudi Arabia access, leverage and technological 
proximity it would not get anywhere else. But where will the money come from? 
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) is the country's sovereign wealth fund 
established in 1971. It is one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds and 
serves as the main engine for Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, investing in a wide range of 
domestic and international opportunities, including strategic sectors and large-scale 
giga-projects within the Kingdom, and also makes significant   global investments. 
While PIF projects an image of massive wealth and ambition, liquidity challenges and 
underperforming projects — think of NEOM and other giga-projects — reveal 
constraints. PIF’s assets (~$1 trillion) are largely tied up in illiquid projects, limiting 
immediate capital for new deals. Behind the scenes, the fund is restructuring 
operations, cutting projections and changing leadership in troubled projects. 
Realignments are natural and the Kingdom will continue to generate free cash from 
its energy exports. However, the scenario suggests that Western partners should be 
----------------Page (41) Break----------------
increasingly prepared to also deploy capital in the Kingdom, not just draw resources 
from there. Like him or not, MBS is driving a major transformation in Saudi Arabia. It 
is not an isolated case, as the UAE shows. This brings to the table a fundamental 
and uncomfortable question for Western democracies: can they succeed in building 
and executing strategic visions to transform themselves as countries in the Middle 
East are? 
While China continues expanding its footprint in the Gulf, Washington is doubling 
down on Riyadh. The Middle East is once again becoming a battlefield   of influence, 
but the game is different this time. The next decade of geopolitics and tech will not 
be a tedious one.

 Quantum: Japan bets big on optical computation 
↳ Why it matters 
NTT and OptQC have signed an agreement to build a 1-million-qubit optical quantum 
computer by 2030, a scale previously considered closer to science fiction than 
engineering reality. Optical approaches promise higher stability, lower error rates and 
more scalability than traditional superconducting designs. The announcement 
bridges two areas that are experiencing progress and for which there are high 
expectations — quantum and optical computation — across the world. If achieved, 
this would be a big feat. A 1-million-qubit quantum computer would radically change 
what is computationally possible: molecular simulations at atomic accuracy, 
real-time global logistics optimisation, unbreakable encryption and AI models that 
----------------Page (42) Break----------------
make today’s frontier systems look small. And it would signal something bigger — 
we would be moving from “quantum promise” to “quantum industrialisation.” 
However, optical computation still is in its early days and the promise of functional 
quantum computing has been a moving target for quite some time. Anyone 
interested in the theme and the potential impacts these technologies can have must 
carefully follow the technical advancements that may arise from the initiative. But 
there is more here. Having two Japanese companies pushing this forward is a major 
thing. Japan has lost its leadership position in semiconductors. If successful, this 
initiative could open new frontiers for Japanese competitiveness and global 
leadership. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
To be realized, this feat will require technology developments and even 
breakthroughs in different domains, but the two Japanese players seem to be well 
positioned for the challenge. OptQC has successfully developed the world’s first new 
optical quantum computer that operates at room temperature and pressure. In 
January 2025, researchers at NTT, the Graduate School of Engineering at the 
University of Tokyo and the National Institute of Information and Communications 
Technology realized the world’s first general-purpose optical quantum computing 
platform capable of performing calculations using optical pulses with strong 
quantum properties. 
At the same time, we are seeing a surge in optical computing research across the 
world. Here's an example: about three months ago, Arago, a hyped Paris-based 
startup, announced a $26 million seed round with investors from the U.S. and 
Europe. They plan to take to the market an optical computer chip and a stack of 
software solutions to seamlessly integrate those with existing computer systems. 
Quantum has lived in the realm of prototypes, not platforms. What I find most 
fascinating is the shift from “let’s explore the physics” to “let’s engineer the 
----------------Page (43) Break----------------
roadmap.” If they deliver even half of this, the quantum race will look very different by 
the end of the decade. Make your bets.

 Europe: can it unleash its deep-tech potential? 
↳ Why it matters 
A new analysis shows that European deep-tech and life-sciences spinouts now reach 
a combined valuation of $398 billion, driven by university–industry pipelines and a 
surge in frontier-tech investment. From quantum and synthetic biology to med-tech 
and advanced materials, Europe’s innovation ecosystems are scaling faster and 
more seriously than many expected. This is not about chasing Silicon Valley. It is 
about Europe building its own innovation architecture rooted in research density, 
strong public funding and rising private deep-tech capital. Although a big gap with 
the U.S. and China persists, Europe certainly has a chance in a world increasingly 
dominated by disputes over critical, science-intensive technologies. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Europe often gets framed as “slow” in tech, but that thinking misses a critical point: 
deep-tech is where the continent excels and could build an edge. Strong universities, 
a highly educated and specialised talent pool and the availability of long-term capital 
make Europe one of the best places in the world for science-driven companies to 
emerge. The big issue is whether they have a business environment that is 
conducive to growth. One missing piece is venture capital — the percentage of VC 
----------------Page (44) Break----------------
capital invested in Europe as a fraction of total global VC dollars is less than 
Europe's share of global GDP; by contrast, the global share of VC capital invested in 
the U.S. is more than twice its share of global GDP. This gap is even more 
pronounced in later stages. To compound the situation, IPOs are much more limited 
in Europe (think London, for instance) than in the U.S. 
Something that stands out in Europe is the diversification  of deep-tech and 
asset-heavy areas in which the continent has strong technical capabilities: quantum, 
nuclear, biotech, advanced materials, space, neurotech, robotics and others. The 
foundations are there and the bottlenecks of Europe’s competitiveness are mostly 
known, as the Draghi report unveiled. If Europe succeeds in advancing 
commercialisation and funding scale in a market-driven way, historically its weak 
points, this $398 billion could be just the beginning.

 Drinks are changing... and digital may make a 
difference 
↳ Why it matters 
The global coffee shop market is massive—valued between $70 and $220 
billion—and growing fast with a 7.1% CAGR. The growing participation of Chinese 
coffee shop (and tea) retail brands in the U.S. and other markets is not just about 
good money, it’s a sign of changing lifestyles. For years, Starbucks symbolized global 
coffee culture, expanding aggressively in China, at one point opening a new store 
every day. Now things are shifting. Starbucks is reportedly selling a major stake in its 
China business to a private equity fund, while Chinese coffee brands such as Luckin 
Coffee, Heytea, Chagee, and Mixue are entering the U.S. market. And they are doing 
so with a different playbook: digital first, lower touch, and flavor forward. This is not 
just about coffee. It is about how consumer habits, brand preferences, and cultural 
exports are changing. And about who wins in this new phase. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
It started with small electronics, phones, PCs, and EVs. Brands like Geely, Lenovo, 
Huawei, Haier, and BYD were barely known globally ten years ago. Now they’re 
everywhere—especially in the Global South. Ask young people in Africa what phone 
or car they want, and odds are it’s Chinese. And European brands? Largely out of the 
----------------Page (46) Break----------------
picture. Now it is coffee and beverages. What is new is that Chinese consumer 
brands are entering the most competitive retail market in the world: the U.S. They’re 
not just producing goods; they’re building experiences and aiming to capture hearts, 
taste buds, and loyalty, especially from younger generations. So here’s the big 
question: Are Chinese brands more digitally ready and culturally tuned to win Gen Z 
and Gen Alpha than legacy Western names in food, retail, and lifestyle? To close: 
have you thought about the day when you will crave a Chinese burger?

 AI started to discover... and it is just getting started 
↳ Why it matters 
A paper in Nature released this past week shows that researchers in China have 
introduced AI-Newton, a system capable of discovering physical laws directly from 
raw experimental data with no human guidance. It analyzes messy observations, 
generates hypotheses, rules out inconsistent explanations, and converges on 
equations that describe the real world, including versions of Newton’s second law. 
Also this past week, Edison, a company in San Francisco spun off from Future 
House, a nonprofit dedicated to building AI agents to automate research, released 
Kosmos, an “AI Scientist” for autonomous discovery. Science is changing for good 
and for real, in real time. 
This marks a turning point: AI moves from being a prediction tool to becoming a 
scientific   discovery engine, potentially uncovering hidden structures in nature and 
accelerating breakthroughs that would traditionally take years of human work. And 
----------------Page (47) Break----------------
science is one of the highest-level human activities, and AI will transform it like 
everything else. Scientific   discovery can also accelerate—Edison claims that a single 
Kosmos run can accomplish work equivalent to six months of a PhD or postdoctoral 
scientist. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
We have long assumed that science—forming hypotheses, abstract reasoning, 
intuition—was a uniquely human domain. But if an AI can infer core physical 
principles from scratch, we may be witnessing the rise of a new kind of scientist: 
nonhuman, tireless, and capable of exploring theoretical spaces we have not even 
imagined, conceptualizing experiments, and processing experimental data at 
unparalleled speed. 
The question shifts from “What can AI learn?” to “What can AI reveal that we don’t 
yet know how to ask?” And... “What will scientists do?” This reframes everything: 
validation, regulation, and the very role of human researchers. If machines start 
generating hypotheses at scale, our job may increasingly be to interrogate and 
interpret what they uncover. And it is not far-fetched to imagine that the next major 
scientific   leap will not originate from a university lab, but from a model running 
quietly on a cluster somewhere in China or in San Francisco.

 Choose a location to call your own (and secure, 
hopefully) 
----------------Page (48) Break----------------
↳ Why it matters 
A new Gartner survey shows that 61% of CIOs and IT leaders in Western Europe plan 
to shift toward local or regional cloud providers because of rising geopolitical risks. 
Concerns around digital sovereignty, data jurisdiction, and foreign dependencies are 
pushing enterprises to rethink their cloud architecture. This is not just about security, 
it is a structural shift in how organizations choose infrastructure. Global hyperscalers 
may remain dominant, but governments and regulated industries increasingly want 
clouds they can politically trust, not only technically rely on. Geopolitics has become 
dominant, at least for those who have the strategic capabilities and the space to 
maneuver–most countries don't. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
We talk a lot about chips, AI models and data pipelines, but geopolitics is quietly 
reshaping the foundations underneath all of those. As more countries begin to treat 
cloud infrastructure as a strategic national asset, the entire AI ecosystem must 
adjust—model deployment, data residency, compliance, and vendor selection. For 
companies building AI-first products, this raises new questions: where does your 
model run and under whose jurisdiction, can your stack be deployed regionally 
without losing performance, and how do you prove sovereignty, not just security. 
Cloud sovereignty is becoming the new competitive frontier. In the coming years, 
global by default may give way to regional by design, and those who adapt early will 
define  the next wave of trusted AI infrastructure.

 India aims big; other nations should watch closely 
↳ Why it matters 
This past week, NVIDIA joined India’s Deep Tech Alliance, an ambitious national 
effort to supercharge innovation in AI, semiconductors, advanced computing, 
robotics, and more. When announced by PM Modi, the Alliance was envisioned as a 
$1 billion fund, but media reports indicate it has already reached $1.9 billion. Not 
bad, right? Some Alliance members are contributing capital, while others like NVIDIA 
will provide access to experts, training, and other resources. 
----------------Page (50) Break----------------
The Deep Tech Alliance was created to provide long-term, patient capital for 
deep-tech startups and projects. It will work with various financial partners—from 
DFIs to VC funds—to deploy capital in high-risk, high-return ventures. The initiative 
aims to place India on the global map of frontier tech development. It clearly 
demonstrates (1) the understanding that sovereignty and global leadership depend 
on a country's ability to master, develop, and deploy key non-commodity 
technologies and (2) India’s ability to build large-scale public-private 
partnerships—surely not a commodity on this planet. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
India is a major success in space, and what ISRO has achieved is truly impressive. 
But what many people overlook is that the country has also been innovating in 
institutions to accelerate the translation of technologies into market applications. A 
few years ago, it created NewSpace India. More recently, the country established the 
Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANNRF), another innovative institution 
designed to bridge research and innovation. To leap into the future, it is essential to 
innovate in institutions, and India has been doing just that. Other countries should be 
watching and learning from its experience. Of course, like anywhere else, there is 
room for improvement and adjustment, but the direction is clear and sends a strong 
message. 
With its talent base, data scale, and geopolitical positioning, India has many of the 
elements needed to become the next pole of technological gravity. NVIDIA’s 
involvement—along with that of other corporations and venture firms—adds fuel to 
that vision, but it is not an isolated fact or a government-only effort. The country has 
an exceptional science and technology talent pool and, until recently, was mostly 
known for its digital services sector. Things may be changing. Recently, Google 
announced a massive $15 billion investment in an AI data hub in Bangalore. From 
2024 to 2025, investment in Indian deep tech grew by 78%. The global deep-tech 
race is accelerating, and India is positioning itself as a frontrunner.

 AI goes through the roof, to space! 
↳ Why it matters 
The demand for power used in data centers is soaring. In 2025 alone, it is projected 
to grow by 22%, and it is expected to triple by 2030. AI is hungry. Question: where will 
this power come from, and what are the impacts on Earth? Energy prices are rising, 
and Bloomberg reports that wholesale electricity costs have increased by as much 
as 267% in the last five years in areas near data centers. What is the solution to that? 
Well, MAG7 and other tech companies are betting on nuclear. But what if we had 
other solutions? 
Google Research just released a paper highlighting a fascinating concept: a 
space-based, scalable AI infrastructure. In plain terms, it’s about taking AI training 
and inference infrastructure off Earth—literally. The idea is to harness abundant 
energy availability in space—think of the Sun—and deploy space-based computing 
systems that can scale without the electricity limitations we face on Earth. Beyond 
energy, this points to the tremendous momentum that space, space tech, and the 
new space economy are gaining—and much more is to come. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
----------------Page (52) Break----------------
Satellites in sun-synchronous orbits can harvest up to eight times more solar energy 
than Earth-based panels. Instead of transmitting power back to Earth, Google 
proposes placing data centers directly in orbit. Far-fetched? Well, many companies 
are already developing solutions for that, such as Star Catcher (space power grid), 
Astrolight (space-to-space laser telecommunications), and Seldor Capital’s portfolio 
company LoneStar (data storage and processing). 
When we created Seldor Capital, we mapped various elements needed in space to 
advance exploration—food production, manufacturing, construction, power and 
telecom systems, data storage and processing, and more—and the types of 
solutions required to supply or enable those. In many cases, doing or making things 
in space could also offer advantages, such as lowering cooling and energy 
requirements for data centers. 
We tend to think of AI as software, but it is becoming infrastructure. Space offers 
what Earth increasingly lacks, such as abundant electricity. The question is no longer 
whether we can scale AI, but where we will do it. As we enter this new realm, we are 
building the foundations for interplanetary AI networks and moving from connecting 
devices to connecting assets in space and eventually celestial bodies. Paradoxically, 
the lines between space and Earth are also becoming increasingly blurred.

 The hidden thirst of Artificial  Intelligence 
↳ Why it matters 
----------------Page (53) Break----------------
A new Ecolab study released this past week reveals a startling fact: most consumers 
are unaware of AI’s massive water footprint. From cooling data centers to powering 
training clusters, the surge in generative AI is driving water use to unsustainable 
levels. While tech giants promise carbon neutrality, few talk about water neutrality, 
even though each ChatGPT query or AI-generated image can indirectly consume 
liters of water through energy and cooling cycles. In a world losing freshwater at an 
unprecedented rate, where 25% of the population lacks access to clean drinking 
water, this is a serious issue. But it also signals an opportunity for innovators and 
entrepreneurs—one that major tech companies are already beginning to notice. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
We marvel at the power of AI, but every digital miracle leaves a physical mark. The 
hidden infrastructure of AI—servers, cooling systems, uncountable miles of cables, 
and data hubs—drains water reservoirs worldwide. AI is not just hungry, it is thirsty. 
Ecolab’s research with people in 15 nations shows that only 41% of consumers 
recognize water use in AI operations, compared with 55% who acknowledge its 
significant   power consumption. There is still so much we don’t know. Did you know 
that? 
Some companies position themselves in the global market as clean data center 
providers and operators, using 100% renewable energy. MAG7 companies are 
making major clean energy purchases and betting on nuclear. But what is the next 
competitive edge for data center technology providers and operators? Water 
efficiency in AI. Perhaps the real test for AI is whether its intelligence can include 
self-awareness of its own resource impact and manage that. More to come on this 
front. Cheers!

France drew a line in the sand. Its sports authorities announced that any French 
athlete competing in the upcoming Enhanced Games—a new Olympic-style event 
that openly allows performance-enhancing drugs—will face sanctions. Set to debut 
----------------Page (55) Break----------------
in Las Vegas in May 2026, the Games promise $500,000 prizes per event and 
million-dollar bonuses for world-record performances. Supporters call it a bold 
experiment in human potential. Critics see it as the formalization of doping. For 
everyone else, it’s a clear signal that we’re entering uncharted territory—where 
technology could push human performance to new extremes and widen divides that 
may echo across generations. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
This isn’t just a sports story — it’s a cultural and existential one. The Enhanced 
Games are a mirror held up to our obsession with progress and limits. What happens 
when “human achievement” is no longer bound by biology, but by chemistry, 
technology, and capital? But... wait a minute — aren’t we already there? 
On one side, there’s the allure of freedom and innovation: athletes pushing the 
frontier of what bodies can do. On the other, a moral and medical gray zone that 
could redefine   fairness, health, victory, and what being human really means. Is this a 
stretch? Not really. The race to select and engineer ‘better humans’ is already 
underway — and accelerating. We might be witnessing the moment when sport, like 
so many other human arenas, begins to split: between the natural and the 
engineered. The haves and the have-nots. The ares and the are-nots. Are we ready 
for that?

----------------Page (56) Break----------------
Javier Milei’s party, La Libertad Avanza, scored a sweeping victory in Argentina’s 
midterm elections, winning around 40 percent of the vote and dramatically 
expanding its presence in Congress. In the lower chamber, it jumped from 37 to 80 
seats, while in the Senate, its representation tripled to 20 seats. The result 
strengthens Milei’s mandate to advance his vision — slashing public spending, 
cutting taxes, deregulating the economy and redefining  the role of the state. 
Beyond Argentina’s borders, the outcome reverberates across Latin America and the 
world. It can be seen as part of a broader ideological realignment in the region — but 
also as a bold experiment in overhauling an entire economy and society. Will it 
succeed? Time — and the people — will tell. The real question is whether Milei can 
sustain popular support for his reformist push while loosening labor regulations and 
challenging entrenched interests. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Argentina is the only country in the world that went from being one of the richest to 
becoming a developing one. In 1910, its GDP per capita was 80% of the U.S. level; 
today, it’s around 15%. When did it go south? My take: it started long ago, in the late 
1930s. After the Great Depression, two key things happened. First, working-class 
demands were not met with real solutions. Discontent grew, paving the way for a 
state-controlled labor union system. Second, the country stuck to its agro-export 
model — elites failed to reinvest the capital they had accumulated into building a 
diversified,  future-oriented economy. Which country did the opposite? The United 
States under FDR. The New Deal expanded industrial capacity and innovation, and 
WWII supercharged it, turning the U.S. into the innovation powerhouse we know 
today. 
Back to Argentina: what’s happening under the Milei administration is an experiment 
— a bold attempt to rewrite the rules of the economy and society (according to 
Milei's view, naturally), hoping to cure decades of inflation, stagnation, erosion of 
capabilities and mistrust. Facts are still unfolding and results remain to be seen. 
----------------Page (57) Break----------------
Argentina’s journey from the 1940s to the 2020s has been turbulent — marked by 
economic instability, dictatorship, a stupid war and decline. In the early 1970s, 
poverty was around 5%; today, it’s over 35%, down from 55% at the height of Milei’s 
initial reforms in 2024. For decades, poverty was addressed through a patchwork of 
social programs and government initiatives, not by tackling the structural causes of 
underperformance. Fixing that is tough — far easier said and written from my couch 
than done. 
Milei’s 2023 election was more than a political victory — it was a declaration that 
enough is enough. People, exhausted by decades of mismanagement, wanted a 
solution, whatever it might be. Milei turned rage into a political engine and 
economics into identity. Whether Argentina finds prosperity or deeper fracture will 
hinge on one question: can the dismantling of social programs and government 
interventions coexist with social stability? The midterm election results send a clear 
signal: despite the pain, Argentines are choosing to go further down Milei’s path. 
Whatever happens next, Argentina has become a must-follow case for the world.

 We need leaders equipped to avoid false climate 
paradoxes 
↳ Why it matters 
Bill Gates made headlines last week with a clear message: we need to reprioritize 
climate investments. Around the same time, Brazil approved a license for Petrobras 
to drill an offshore oil well—500 km (311 miles) from the mouth of the Amazon 
River. All of this unfolds as the country prepares to host COP30. To many, these 
----------------Page (58) Break----------------
moves look contradictory—even counter to the fight against climate change. But 
that may not be the case. They reflect the complex balancing act of our time: 
securing energy, lifting people out of poverty (and strengthening social contracts in 
the process), advancing climate goals and adapting to a world already being 
reshaped by climate change. 
Extreme weather events are no longer rare. As we speak, another hurricane has 
devastated Jamaica and parts of the Caribbean. And while the impacts of climate 
change are global, so is the need for investment. Climate change is real—it’s 
happening—and fighting it demands new technology, capital and economic models. 
We’re seeing progress. In the first half of 2025, global power demand grew by 369 
TWh, but solar and wind additions exceeded that growth by 9%. For the first time, 
we’re adding more clean power than demand is rising. That’s remarkable. Yet, 
technology alone won’t solve the problem if we can’t fund environmental law 
enforcement, innovation and inclusion—especially in places like the Amazon, where 
people will resort to low-productivity, high-impact activities, like cutting down 
forests, if they lack alternatives and support to make a living. Paradoxically, 
developing fossil energy resources can generate the capital needed to fund those 
transitions and protections. Leaders must be able to weigh all these 
dimensions—and we should vote for those who can. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
In Brazil, 47% of emissions come from land-use change, agriculture, and 
deforestation—a very different profile  from global emissions. And behind those 
emissions are 40 million people living in the Amazon region, many without access 
to quality jobs, education, capital, or opportunities to thrive. If we fail to provide 
economic alternatives, they will continue turning to low-productivity activities like 
cutting trees just to survive. That’s the point. Sustainability is not only about 
protecting the forest—it’s about people, productivity and prosperity. It’s about 
----------------Page (59) Break----------------
ensuring that transitions are economically viable, that innovation reaches the 
ground and that people and places are not left behind. 
At the GFCC, the message we keep reinforcing is clear: sustainability happens at 
the intersection of economy, society, and the environment. We can’t treat those 
dimensions as separate. We need to mobilize investment to build capabilities, scale 
new technologies and lift communities. Yes, it’s complex—but there is no other way 
forward. As we move toward COP30 in Brazil, it’s time to look beyond the headlines 
and focus on the bigger picture. Real climate leadership will come not from 
choosing between energy and environment, but from connecting the dots, aligning 
incentives and building systems that work for people on the ground.

 Are We One Outage Away from Digital Chaos? 
↳ Why it matters 
On October 20, Amazon Web Services experienced a major outage that disrupted 
thousands of websites and apps worldwide, from banks and streaming platforms to 
government services and smart homes. The issue originated in a malfunction in its 
DNS automation system in the US-EAST-1 region and quickly cascaded across the 
network. This exposed a deeper vulnerability: a large portion of the global internet 
now runs on the infrastructure of just a few cloud giants. When one stumbles, the 
ripple effects are global. 
This isn’t just a technical glitch, it’s a structural issue: we are putting way too many 
eggs in one really few baskets. Our digital economy has become highly concentrated 
in the hands of a few providers, creating dependencies that extend far beyond 
convenience. As AI systems, payment networks, healthcare services, and even 
national security increasingly rely on cloud infrastructure, the resilience of our 
societies now hinges on a handful of data centers owned by a few firms. 
----------------Page (61) Break----------------
↳ My thoughts on it 
The internet was once seen as a great equalizer, a universal network meant to 
spread information, foster connections and open space for global dialogue. It 
promised more openness, more inclusion and more democracy. The cloud brought a 
new promise: flexibility, scale and speed. But today, infrastructure equals power. The 
cloud is no longer a neutral layer, it has become a geopolitical, economic, and 
societal lever. And power has become concentrated. AWS holds 30% of the global 
cloud market, ahead of Microsoft’s 20% and Google’s 12%. In a world where AI feeds 
on data, those who own the servers and control the flows have the upper hand. 
Companies, startups, and even governments are no longer just customers, they are 
now subjects in a new era of digital sovereignty, for which rules are being written in 
real time. And while major powers try to shape the rules, one big question remains: 
Can smaller or developing countries really set any terms, or will they just have to 
adapt? What’s at stake isn’t just operational resilience. It’s control, agency and the 
architecture of our digital future.

 The Next Digital Frontier Is Biological 
↳ Why it matters 
This past week, multiple labs reported breakthroughs in using AI to model cellular 
behavior. At the same time, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency 
(CISA) issued new guidance warning that biomanufacturing facilities are becoming 
prime targets for cyber-espionage. In China, the Central Committee of the 
Communist Party of China (CPC) convened its fourth plenary session and reinforced 
a commitment to further advancing technology authonomy – and digital 
----------------Page (62) Break----------------
biotechnology will be a the center of that, with new investments in bioinformatics 
and genome engineering being announced. Digital biotechnology becomes 
increasingly important in today's global competition, its development raises fresh 
questions about data sovereignty and biological IP protection. As biology becomes 
code, the infrastructure of life itself enters the domain of cybersecurity. Leaks or 
manipulations here could have consequences far beyond a data breach. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
For years, we treated biology as physical and digital as virtual. That line is dissolving 
fast. As genomics, synthetic biology, and AI converge, our ability to read, write, and 
simulate life is accelerating, and so are the risks. Cybersecurity is no longer just 
about data. It’s about DNA. It's cyberbiosecurity. The same AI that powers life-saving 
therapies can be used to design pathogens, alter genomes, or exfiltrate genetic data. 
This “bio-knowledge explosion” brings a twin: a bio-security challenge. If recent cloud 
failures have taught us anything, it’s that interconnected systems are only as strong 
as their weakest layer. But what happens when that layer is the foundation of life 
itself? We’ve reached a new frontier, where cybersecurity meets bioengineering, and 
where defending digital systems also means defending our biological future.

 Can Europe Still Lead the Climate Race? 
↳ Why it matters 
At this past week’s European Council summit, leaders struggled to balance climate 
ambition with fiscal and geopolitical realities. With the war in Ukraine reshaping 
Europe’s economy and energy flows, the EU faces a pivotal choice: double down on 
its 2040 climate targets or slow the pace to preserve industrial competitiveness and 
----------------Page (63) Break----------------
social stability. Behind closed doors in Brussels, fractures emerged, northern 
countries pushing for stricter emissions cuts, while southern and eastern members 
called for more flexibility amid inflation and high energy costs. Meanwhile, the 
European Commission faces pressure from environmental groups to uphold its 
credibility ahead of COP30, as major investors warn that climate policy uncertainty 
could deter capital from Europe’s green industries. Europe’s climate leadership, once 
a global benchmark, is now up for negotiation and the future of cleantech 
technologies and projects is up in the air in many parts of the world. What Europe as 
a whole or its members countries individually decide will send important signals 
globally. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Europe has long been the most vocal advocate for global climate policy, but 
leadership demands more than ambition, it requires alignment. What we’re seeing 
now is the geopolitical cost of the energy transition colliding with political fatigue. 
Every percentage point of emissions reduction carries industrial, social, and 
diplomatic trade-offs, but also creates major opportunities for innovation. Like other 
technological shifts, decarbonization will produce big winners, those who bring new 
solutions to market - and big losers - firms that fail to adapt. The real risk is political: 
when citizens feel like they are the losers, transformation collapses. With the war in 
Ukraine driving up energy prices, that seems increasingly to be the case. 
If decarbonization becomes a bargaining chip traded for defense spending, inflation 
control, or electoral relief, Europe may lose not only momentum but its credibility as 
a global standard-setter. And let’s be honest: how could European leaders expect to 
poke Russia with NATO expansion, underinvest in defense, still wait for the US to pay 
the bill and come to rescue them and keep energy prices stable thanks to the gas 
supply from Russia? The question now is not whether Europe leads, but whether it 
can reinvent its model of leadership... before others fill the vacuum.

 The Death of Truth: When Seeing Is No Longer 
Believing 
↳ Why it matters 
We’ve entered an era where truth itself is under siege. OpenAI’s Sora can now 
generate ultra-realistic videos from simple text prompts, an astonishing leap forward 
in AI’s creative capability. But with this progress comes an uncomfortable reality: 
fake news is no longer crude or detectable. As tools like Sora democratize the power 
to create lifelike video fakes, uncertainty and risk are multiplying across every layer 
of society. Trust, already fragile, is eroding even further. The old saying “seeing is 
believing” no longer holds true; today, what the eyes see may deceive the heart. From 
----------------Page (65) Break----------------
cybersecurity and crime to manipulation of public debate, the implications are 
immense. This shift will not only redefine   how we verify truth, but also introduce new 
costs and risks across cybersecurity, commerce, and human relationships. We’re not 
just witnessing a technological advance—we’re facing the birth of a new information 
battlefield.   
↳ My thoughts on it 
It’s both fascinating and deeply concerning. What we’re seeing with Sora is not a 
glitch, it’s the next frontier. Soon, it will be almost impossible to tell what’s real and 
what’s not. There are already cases—like a 2024 incident where a fund manager 
wired $25 million after a deepfake Zoom call with someone who looked and sounded 
exactly like his boss. These are not science fiction anymore. They’re happening now. 
So, what comes next? We’ll need new layers of verification, biometric, behavioral, 
maybe even genetic. The future of trust will depend on authentication. Just as your 
browser shows a security lock, our calls, videos, and even human interactions may 
soon display a “trust score.” In the end, AI isn’t killing truth, it’s forcing us to reinvent 
it.

 Above the Clouds, Beyond the Markets 
↳ Why it matters 
The global space economy has entered a new orbit, one that could reach $1.8 trillion 
by 2035, according to McKinsey. What was once the realm of superpowers is now 
the backbone of a fast-emerging economic system. The surge is being driven not 
only by launch services and satellite constellations but also by downstream 
----------------Page (66) Break----------------
applications, from climate analytics and logistics to secure global connectivity and 
in-orbit manufacturing. Space is quietly becoming the next layer of global 
infrastructure: an ecosystem of data, defense, and communication that underpins 
life on Earth. 
Even countries outside the traditional space race are joining in. Brazil, for instance, 
partnered with South Korea in a satellite launch, an example of how emerging 
economies are beginning to participate, test technologies, and learn within this 
expanding frontier, despite the structural challenges ahead. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Space is no longer a stage for prestige, it’s an engine of productivity. As we move 
toward the trillion-dollar era, the real value won’t come from rockets alone, but from 
the intelligence they enable: orbital data powering Earth systems, communications, 
AI models, and even climate governance. In other words, space is becoming our 
planet’s digital twin, and whoever controls its data pipelines will shape how the world 
connects, competes, and survives.

 When DNA Meets Data: The Computational Turn of 
Big Pharma 
↳ Why it matters 
AstraZeneca’s $555 million deal with U.S. biotech startup Algen is more than another 
AI partnership, it’s a signal of where the pharmaceutical industry is headed. The next 
generation of drug discovery is being built on computation. From startups training 
----------------Page (67) Break----------------
generative models on massive genomic datasets to platforms predicting molecular 
interactions in silico, biology is becoming a branch of computer science. AI is not 
just accelerating drug development, it’s reshaping who gets to play the game. Those 
without computational power will be locked out. That’s why Big Pharma now faces a 
simple choice: build AI capabilities in-house, partner with those who have them, or 
risk irrelevance. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Every industry becomes a computing industry, pharma is no exception. The 
pharmaceutical company of the future will be two things: a computational core that 
designs and simulates therapies, and a distribution network that connects them to 
doctors and patients. That channel, built over decades—remains Big Pharma’s most 
valuable asset. But the lab, as we knew it, is being virtualized. Still, there’s a paradox. 
These technologies promise precision and control, yet we’re only beginning to grasp 
their complexity. Look at today’s weight-loss injections, remarkably effective, but with 
still-unclear neurological effects. The more we digitize biology, the more we’ll 
confront what we don’t yet understand about the human brain. Let’s hope AI helps us 
discover not just faster, but wiser. The real challenge is ensuring this revolution 
lowers costs and truly expands access to better health, not just accelerates the price 
of innovation.

 A Next Billion-Dollar Layer of the Sky 
↳ Why it matters 
A week ago, dozens of drones suddenly fell from the sky in China—check the footage 
in the links. The incident highlights the rise of a new economy quietly forming just 
above our heads—between ground level and a few thousand feet in the air—where 
China is the dominant player. It also shows how far we still have to go before this 
“low-altitude economy” can safely take off, especially when it comes to securing 
drone operations (and protecting everyone below). 
The potential of this new economy is enormous, but for now, it remains highly 
concentrated. In Hong Kong alone, 38 pilot projects are already testing low-altitude 
operations. One Chinese company—DJI—controls about 70% of the global drone 
market. Across China, more than 14,000 companies are authorized to operate 
drones, with 225,000 licensed pilots and thousands more in training to power this 
booming aerial sector. 
Governments worldwide are racing to catch up and define  the rules that will enable 
this new economic layer. In the U.S., the FAA is considering removing the line-of-sight 
requirement for drone operations. But safety, regulation, communication networks, 
air traffic  systems and cyber-resilience all need to mature quickly. The sky may well 
be the next economic frontier—but only if we can make it safe. 
----------------Page (69) Break----------------
↳ My thoughts on it 
This emerging economy spans cargo delivery between ports and cities, drone light 
shows and electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles (eVTOLs) transporting 
people in dense urban areas. It’s where aviation, urban mobility, logistics, security 
and digital infrastructure converge. But managing thousands of autonomous flying 
machines in crowded urban environments demands real-time communication, 
AI-driven air traffic  control, reliable energy systems and, above all, trust and 
functional institutions — it’s a massive systems challenge. 
Solving it will require coordination among governments, technology developers, 
infrastructure and logistics operators and the public — one misstep away from chaos 
in the skies. It will take heavy investment and constant innovation. Can other 
countries catch up and challenge China in the years ahead? Europe has launched a 
drone strategy — will it translate into a real industrial push? In the U.S., the 
administration aims to accelerate unmanned aerial vehicle integration into business 
operations through more flexible regulation. The first countries to master this and 
build the industrial capacity to scale solutions won’t just create a new industry — 
they’ll own the new sky.

 Humanoids are Coming to Your Home 
↳ Why it matters 
Two days ago, robotics startup Figure AI dropped a major signal: its next-generation 
humanoid, Figure 03, is moving out of the lab and toward real-world deployment. 
----------------Page (70) Break----------------
This isn’t a minor upgrade from Figure 02—it’s a bold bet that robots are ready to 
leave factories and enter households, logistics hubs and everyday environments. 
Figure’s announcement marks a major inflection point for robotics: the shift from 
robots for industry to robots for life. If they succeed in building a capable, safe and 
affordable robot that works seamlessly around humans, it could spark a wave of 
adoption that reshapes labor markets, home design and regulation. For now, the 
projected price tag is between $20,000 and $30,000—roughly the cost of an 
entry-level car in the U.S.—about what Elon Musk has floated for Tesla’s Optimus. 
Meanwhile, in China, Engine AI is promising a humanoid companion priced around 
$5,300. The age of humanoid robots is here to stay. But we’re still in the early 
days—and both the market and the industry are just beginning to stand up. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
As in most critical technology arenas, the U.S. and China are locked in fierce 
competition. Dozens of companies across both countries—and a few in Europe—are 
racing to develop humanoid robots. Curiously, Japan, which once pioneered robotics, 
now seems to be lagging behind, with its efforts still focused on industrial robots or 
entertainment-style machines that look more like toys or cartoon characters than 
humanoids. 
Back to Figure AI—and to what may give them an edge. Their Figure 02 model has 
reportedly been operating autonomously at a BMW manufacturing site in Germany 
for months. The company is building its own battery system, designing for mass 
production, and has already demonstrated early walking and manipulation 
milestones. By choosing to own the full technology stack—battery, actuators, 
software, and hardware—Figure gains tighter control over integration and reliability. 
Their partnership with Brookfield,  one of the world’s largest real estate developers, to 
create large-scale datasets and infrastructure hints at a broader vision: robots not 
just as prototypes, but as deployable assets at global scale. Even if Figure 03 doesn’t 
yet cook dinner or fold laundry next year, its launch pushes the entire field 
----------------Page (71) Break----------------
forward—especially in the West. It raises the bar for competitors, regulators, and 
suppliers alike. 
And speaking of competitors—have you seen the latest Tesla Optimus videos? In one 
clip, the robot performs a karate kata, even sparring briefly  with a human. Impressive, 
yes—but also unsettling. Imagine what happens when these machines get really 
good. What if one goes rogue? The future of humanoids is coming fast—and it’s 
equal parts exciting and terrifying. Are we ready for that?

 Computing Beyond the Cloud 
↳ Why it matters 
The computer cloud may soon leave Earth’s atmosphere. A few days ago in Italy, Jeff 
Bezos predicted that within 10 to 20 years, we could see data centers in orbit, 
powered by limitless solar energy and cooled by the vacuum of space. From 
Starcloud’s and Lonestar’s orbital and lunar prototypes to Axiom Space’s modular 
computing stations, a new frontier is emerging—where aerospace meets digital 
infrastructure. To advance space exploration, as we mapped at Seldor Capital, we’ll 
need computing and storage capacity in space—not to mention capabilities to 
produce food, fuel and manufactured goods beyond Earth. What seemed futuristic a 
few years ago, when we invested in LoneStar, is now entering the mainstream. We 
bet on that. 
----------------Page (72) Break----------------
There are also very earthly reasons for this shift. Running AI and data processing in 
orbit could mean unlimited clean energy, near-zero cooling costs, and global 
redundancy against terrestrial failures. But new opportunities bring new dilemmas: 
who regulates data outside national borders? How do you patch a server 500 
kilometers above the ground? While the technical challenges are immense, the 
governance and regulatory questions may prove even harder. Space-based data 
centers will force humanity to rewrite the rules for how we store, protect and access 
Earth-originated information—ushering in not just a new computing era, but a new 
chapter in digital sovereignty. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
We tend to think of “the cloud” as intangible, but in reality, it’s built on billions of 
watts of power, tons of steel, and massive cooling systems. And data centers keep 
multiplying. Moving that infrastructure into orbit is the ultimate abstraction — digital 
infrastructure literally detached from the planet. While this may sound like science 
fiction — and yes, I was once asked if I was crazy for investing in it — there’s a solid 
economic rationale behind the idea, beyond the needs of space missions 
themselves. The CAPEX may be enormous, but the OPEX of orbital data centers 
could be significantly  lower than on Earth. Why? Because cooling and energy — two 
of the biggest operational costs — are virtually free in space, thanks to the vacuum 
and constant solar exposure. 
Whoever builds the first functional, secure space data center will become a pioneer 
in interplanetary computing. Still, reliability and repair remain huge hurdles — you 
can’t just send a technician on a rocket for a reboot. But that challenge will, in turn, 
create new opportunities for space robotics and autonomous maintenance systems. 
The future of computing won’t just be distributed — it will be distributed at a 
planetary, and soon interplanetary, scale. Fasten your seatbelts. We’re accelerating 
toward that future, even if most people still can’t quite visualize it.

----------------Page (74) Break----------------
redirects—purchases happen natively. Merchants pay commissions; users pay 
nothing extra. This marks a shift from AI as adviser to AI as actor—the platform 
doesn’t just suggest, it executes. OpenAI is moving beyond subscriptions into 
commerce, challenging e-commerce infrastructure incumbents. With the global 
e-commerce market at ~$30 trillion (B2B included) and digital ads at $600–850 
billion, the potential is massive. 
↳ My Thoughts On It 
This is bold—embedding commerce directly into conversation compresses 
discovery, decision and purchase. The potential for AI-powered e-commerce is huge, 
and we’re just scratching the surface. If OpenAI nails trust, fairness in rankings and 
fraud defense, this could rewrite how we shop online. The ripple effects on digital 
ads and e-commerce could be massive. Markets are watching: between Sep 29 and 
Oct 1, Google shares dropped 1.7% before recovering. Amazon? Its stock actually 
rose on the 29th. But this is just the beginning. 
OpenAI generated $4.3B in revenue in the first half of 2025—already 16% more than 
all of 2024. Still, it burned $2.5B in the same period. AI is changing everything, but AI 
companies need new revenue streams. As they build them, others will lose slices of 
the pie.

 Can we regenerate organs? The regenerative 
frontier accelerates 
↳ Why It Matters 
----------------Page (75) Break----------------
A new study published in September 2025 shows that stem cell injections can 
reverse brain damage from stroke in mice—the cells survive, differentiate and 
connect with native neurons over weeks. Earlier this year, Stanford scientists also 
reported success growing vascularized mini-organs (heart, liver organoids) with their 
own blood vessels—a major step toward lab-grown organs for therapies. 
A whole new wave of therapies is likely to reach the market in the coming decade. 
We may finally be moving from damage control to regeneration and, later, to 
prevention at the molecular and cellular level. New research and commercial 
application areas will emerge, creating value and reshaping health systems, 
economies and societies. Those developing and bringing new health technologies to 
market will generate major returns, and people around the world will benefit,   
although access will remain a challenge, especially at the start. 
↳My Thoughts On It 
We’re inching closer to a future where organ damage isn’t permanent. The leap from 
small animal models and organoids to human-scale safe therapies is still huge, but 
the pace is accelerating. The real test will be translation: scaling, regulatory safety, 
immune compatibility. Yet the direction is transformative. 
In 1900, the average life expectancy at birth was 32 years. Today, the global average 
is more than 73. Most of that progress came from public health, vaccines and 
antibiotics. We succeeded in dealing with many exogenous causes of disease, but 
our bodies still degenerate over time. Non-infectious chronic diseases remain the 
main causes of death and disability in advanced and even developing economies. 
Why do bodies degenerate? In short, because the balance between damage and 
self-repair tips toward damage. At some point in the future—hopefully sooner rather 
than later—we may be able to move beyond restoring function to actually preventing 
cellular and molecular degeneration. 
But don’t forget: in any scenario, it’s still your task to take care of your own body.

 Can the Amazon become an innovation engine? 
↳ Why It Matters 
Brazil was on the spot during New York’s Climate Week 2025, and the potential of the 
Brazilian bioeconomy was highlighted last week by the Swiss State Secretary for 
Education, Research and Innovation—far away from the Amazon, right? 
A key talking point: Brazil’s bioeconomy is projected to generate hundreds of billions 
of US dollars annually by leveraging the Amazon’s biological diversity (pharma, 
biomaterials, food). The environmental services the Amazon as a whole—not just the 
Brazilian part—provides are valued at $275 billion per year, according to NIH 
estimates. Water regulation alone accounts for about 60% of the income of Brazilian 
agribusiness. And the impacts go beyond Brazil—the U.S. Midwest is “irrigated” by 
water pumped into the atmosphere by the Amazon. 
If Brazil and other Amazonian countries could better understand—we know so 
little—and create value from the forest, that would be a net positive for them and for 
the world. New models of socio-bioeconomy are emerging, combining Indigenous 
knowledge, conservation and high-tech, but they are still nascent and don't have 
scale. Much more is needed through a consistent and steady commitment to 
building a knowledge-intensive Amazonian economy. 
↳ My Thoughts On It 
----------------Page (77) Break----------------
These days, the focus on Brazil has clear reasons: it is the most biodiverse country in 
the world (and—what most people don’t know—it also has the most diverse human 
population, check the links), hosts about 60% of the Amazon forest and will host 
COP30. But how can we create more value from the Amazon? Preservation is 
essential, but the real bottleneck to building a robust bioeconomy is not nature—it’s 
research, business capabilities, structures and resources. Nature alone is not 
enough. 
A fundamental part of the equation must be understanding nature. We lack data, 
information and even tools. Initiatives such as the XPrize Rainforest are critical in 
this context. The need for nature tech entrepreneurs and companies is gigantic. 
Global cooperation could help, but through new models. Instead of traditional ODA, 
imagine top global universities establishing campuses and operations in the 
Amazon. The Swiss seem to have an eye on that. Who else?

Weekly Snapshot - Sep 28, 2025 
 
 Are we witnessing the birth of a new business 
model for space? 
↳ Why it matters 
Vast Space, a super well-funded US startup, made headlines last week all the way to 
New Zealand—a country betting on space tech as a driver of future growth. The 
company has reached a key milestone in building Haven-1, the world’s first 
commercial space station, planned for launch into low-Earth orbit by May 2026. 
Haven-1 is now fully welded—watch the video on Vast’s website. Designed with 
human comfort in mind, it features private sleeping quarters, panoramic windows, 
Starlink internet and optimized workspaces. 
Unlike the International Space Station, always a government-led initiative, Haven-1 
will be privately owned and operated. It is conceived as a platform for scientific   
research, in-orbit manufacturing and private astronaut missions, even opening the 
door to space tourism. But the real breakthrough is its concept: “space-as-a-service.” 
Agencies, companies and individuals will be able to rent orbital time and 
infrastructure, and even share the investment. A new business and organizational 
model will be put to the test. If Vast succeeds, 2026 may be remembered as the year 
space tech adopted a new business model. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The rise of private spacetech mirrors, in some ways, what happened in the early 
years of commercial aviation, when state-led development slowly gave way to a 
vast—pun intended—industry. 
----------------Page (79) Break----------------
Haven-1 still has a way to go, and if it actually launches and operates successfully in 
2026, Haven-2—potentially replacing the ISS—would only come in 2032. Vast’s 
aggressive outreach to partners signals that space is becoming a domain where 
CAPEX can be shared, and infrastructure itself becomes an asset to be rented. Think 
efficiency in the use of space assets. From my auto industry background, this feels 
like a mix of Volkswagen’s “modular consortium” in its Brazilian truck plant and a 
shared infrastructure you pay per use. 
A personal note: Interstellar Lab, a company Seldor Capital has invested in, is one of 
Vast’s partners. Its plant growth chamber, Eden 1.0, will be integrated into the lab. 
Exciting times are ahead, and I’ll be watching closely.

 Can we predict the sun before it knocks out our 
systems? 
↳ Why it matters 
Last Wednesday, NASA and NOAA launched three new missions—IMAP, the 
Carruthers Geocorona Observatory and SWFO-L1—to map how the Sun interacts with 
the Solar System and monitor solar storms that threaten satellites, power grids and 
even internet cables, datacenters and microprocessors on Earth. These launches 
highlight how protecting space and electronic infrastructures has become a critical 
----------------Page (80) Break----------------
priority as our dependence on satellites and computation deepens across all 
technological layers. You may not notice it, but much of what you do relies on space 
technologies—and when solar storms hit, the costs are felt on Earth. Just imagine if 
GPS stopped working. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
As orbits grow more crowded and reliance on space, power and data infrastructures 
deepens, predicting solar storms with greater accuracy will be essential to mitigate 
failures, damage and disruptions across critical chains like communications, 
networks and navigation. This new generation of space-weather sensors could 
become part of the backbone of resilience—in space and on Earth. 
The bigger issue is how vulnerable we are to disruptions in power and computation, 
things most of the world takes for granted and rarely sees. Risk management 
remains poorly established and even less valued than it should be. The question is: 
what risks are we not aware of and not managing in our complex planet?

 What does China’s new emissions pledge say to the 
world? 
↳ Why it matters 
----------------Page (81) Break----------------
China is the world’s largest carbon emitter—what it does, or doesn’t do, matters for 
everyone. This past week, in a video statement during the UN General Assembly, 
President Xi Jinping pledged to peak emissions by 2030 and cut them by 7–10% by 
2035. The scientific   consensus is clear: this is not enough to keep global warming 
below 1.5°C—or even 2.0°C. Europe quickly responded, calling China’s goals 
insufficient.  China, in turn, accused the EU of hypocrisy. But this goes far beyond 
diplomatic sparring. The stakes are geopolitical. With the U.S. stepping back from 
international climate leadership, a void is emerging. And in climate—as in 
geopolitics—there are no vacuums. Someone will fill the space. From EVs to solar, 
batteries to grid-scale renewables, China has invested heavily and leads in multiple 
clean tech markets—and ‘climate leadership’ has special significance  and value in 
that backdrop. But the math is brutal: if the world’s biggest polluter doesn’t do 
more—and all other too, we all fall short. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Yes, China has made remarkable progress in clean technology. It leads the world in 
solar panels, battery production and electric vehicles. But momentum matters in 
building a global market presence. So does perception. China’s long-term industrial 
bets are inseparable from its climate policy and geopolitical standing. Still, let’s be 
honest. The global climate shortfall isn’t China’s fault alone. Most advanced and 
emerging economies are also falling behind. What makes this moment troubling is 
the widening gap between what’s needed and what’s being done—by everyone. If this 
is the defining  challenge of our time, we must ask: are countries truly preparing for 
the world that’s coming? The window is closing.

 Why is Mexico raising tariffs on Chinese EVs? 
↳ Why it matters  
Mexico’s decision to impose tariffs on Chinese automotive imports is portrayed in 
the media as having sparked outrage in Beijing. But as we all know, this is not just 
about cars. Deeply integrated with the U.S. economy, the country is dancing a 
complex dance with its neighbor in the north while trying to keep its auto 
manufacturing sector afloat. So far, the dance with the U.S. seems to be working and 
underscores Claudia Sheinbaum’s administration’s ability to navigate turbulent 
waters—others should learn from that. Strictly on cars, Mexico’s move—coupled with 
new restrictions in Europe—challenges China’s expanding global footprint in electric 
vehicles and green manufacturing. Things may not be so easy after all. It calls for a 
----------------Page (83) Break----------------
strategy review in China’s auto industry and in government policies backing its global 
expansion. Still, it is too early—only time will tell what really happens. 
↳ My thoughts on it  
By hitting Chinese vehicles, Mexico is sending signals to Washington, Beijing and 
also to Puebla, Guanajuato and DF–think Mexican automakers. The country is 
betting on its strategic proximity to the U.S. and the future of that relationship—under 
Trump and beyond. Think about this: Mexico has a strategy, and the U.S. is critical to 
it. I first heard this clearly from one of Mexico’s top economists during a visit two 
years ago. But here’s the catch—the strategy is not deliberate, it emerged over time, 
matured and is now consolidated across the political spectrum. Geography matters. 
In doing so, Mexico stands in stark contrast to other emerging nations that 
completely lack strategy. 
This episode also highlights a broader truth: the energy transition—EVs, batteries, 
supply chains—is as much geopolitical as it is technological. The future of cars is 
about trade and strategic alliances, not just engineering.

 Is Meta’s new smart glasses just a gadget or a 
gateway to a new age? 
↳ Why it matters  
----------------Page (84) Break----------------
This past week, Meta unveiled its new generation of AI-powered smart glasses. Yes, 
the demos at Meta Connect had their bugs and glitches, but the direction is clear. 
These glasses promise real-time translation, proactive assistance and an always-on 
interface between the physical and digital worlds. If they work, they could redefine   
how humans interact with information—no screen, just augmented presence. 
Beyond the gadget appeal, this is Meta’s bigger bet: AI + AR as the foundation of the 
next computing platform, reshaping not just entertainment but also work, education 
and daily life. The real implication? Once one of these devices breaks through in the 
market, we’ll hit a turning point—after which the very meaning of phone, computer 
and interface will be rewritten. 
↳ My thoughts on it  
We’ve seen smart glasses before. Remember Google Glass? I tried one in 2013, but it 
was short-lived and never really meant for mass production or broad markets. What 
makes this moment different is the combination of massive advances in hardware 
and the AI layer. We’re no longer just putting notifications in front of our eyes; we’re 
potentially giving ourselves a cognitive co-pilot. The big question is: will people 
embrace this intimacy with AI, or reject it as invasive? 
With Google Glass, the stated issue was privacy, but I believe the real problem was 
performance. From weak displays outdoors to short battery life and the enormous 
challenge of embedding real processing power into AR devices, the limitations of AR 
glasses that have reached the market so far are clear. Are we now reaching the point 
where performance will finally meet the minimum bar customers expect?

 Can AI compress years of drug discovery into 
months? 
↳ Why it matters  
DeepMind’s CEO Demis Hassabis announced that their AI systems can slash drug 
discovery timelines—from years to mere months. This could transform medicine by 
cutting costs, reducing failed trials and speeding treatments for diseases that 
remain stubbornly incurable. But the real story goes beyond efficiency: AI is 
redefining  how science itself is done. We’re getting a sneak peek into a future where 
labs won’t just have scientists but algorithms simulating biology at scale. Will we still 
have humans at the bench in a few years? The first fully AI-designed drug isn’t here 
yet, but it’s coming. And when it does, drug pipelines, pharma business models and 
regulatory systems will all need to adapt. 
↳ My thoughts on it  
We’ve long accepted that drug development is slow, expensive and uncertain. So far! 
AI is starting to bend that reality. About 15 years ago, I was in a conversation about 
using high-performance computing for drug discovery—but AI back then was 
nowhere near today’s level. Now the time has come, and you don’t even need 
supercomputers. This is not only about faster timelines; it’s about who will own the 
“knowledge infrastructure” of life. If private tech players like DeepMind become the 
essential engines of biomedical discovery, how will governments, pharma 
companies, regulators and public health institutions keep up? The upside for 
Google’s DeepMind and other AI powerhouses is gigantic. “AI as a service” for big

pharma could mean big business—and big checks—for them. I anticipate regulators

Weekly Snapshot - Sept 14, 2025 
 
From AI cabinet ministers to billion-dollar biotech bets and Europe’s boldest play yet 
in the AI race, the boundaries of technology, governance, and health are being 
----------------Page (87) Break----------------
redrawn right in front of us. What once felt like distant scenarios, machines shaping 
policy, pharma giants chasing precision cures, Europe flexing tech sovereignty, are 
now hard realities knocking on our doors. 
Let’s dive in! 
 We are witnessing the inauguration of the world’s 
first AI-cabinet minister 
↳ Why it matters 
Albania, under Prime Minister Edi Rama, has appointed Diella, an AI-powered virtual 
assistant, as a legitimate ‘cabinet minister’—really?—in charge of public procurement 
to fight systemic corruption. This is not merely symbolic: launched in January 2025 
on Albania’s e-Albania digital services portal to assist citizens with state paperwork, 
Diella will now oversee the awarding of government tenders. Rama has pledged that 
with Diella, Albania will achieve 100% corruption-free public tenders. This marks a 
new step in using AI in government administration. It will be a test—for the 
technology, for the government and for the idea that AI-based automation can 
reduce corruption. It also raises urgent questions about accountability, oversight, 
bias and how “virtual” actors perform in traditionally human-dominated roles. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Are we entering a moment where “virtual ministers” are no longer science fiction but 
real policy tools? On one hand, using AI in governance to reduce bias, bribery or 
favoritism in procurement could be transformative. On the other, handing such a 
critical function to software gives enormous power to those who design and train it. 
AI already outperforms humans in some areas. It can better assess bail decisions, as 
Malcolm Gladwell notes in Talking to Strangers. It can map connections among laws 
at a scale no human can. In the US, about 200,000 bills are introduced in state 
----------------Page (88) Break----------------
houses each year. I recall meeting FiscalNote’s founders in Silicon Valley in 
2013—they pioneered the use of AI at scale to make sense of legislation and the 
implications across the legal system. In 2014, a top Brazilian lawyer friend told me: 
“As of today, 95% of the work lawyers do in Brazil can already be automated with AI.” 
Imagine today. Again in Brazil, the Federal administration is using AI to process 
social security claims and disputes. But procurement is different. It involves complex 
technical and social processes, often in multiple phases. Corruption often stems 
from inside information or revolving doors. 
So can an AI system be manipulated or gamed? What does “transparent” mean when 
decisions are algorithmic and opaque? How will citizens ensure Diella is fair? And 
how will the EU and others react, given Albania’s ambition to join the bloc by 2030?

 Europe’s AI sovereignty play: ASML  buys into Mistral 
↳ Why it matters 
Dutch ASML, which makes the critical lithography equipment used in chip 
manufacturing, has acquired an 11% stake in French AI startup Mistral, investing 
about $1.5 billion. Mistral is seen as Europe’s crown jewel in generative AI, and the 
deal highlights a coordinated push to build European AI sovereignty in the face of US 
and Chinese dominance. As noted before, AI is not just about technology—it is about 
geopolitics, industrial strength and control over critical infrastructure. This move 
signals Europe’s intent to close the investment gap and retain talent, aiming to be 
more than a regulatory power in tech. Still, compared with the US and China, it 
remains a drop in the ocean. 
----------------Page (89) Break----------------
↳ My thoughts on it 
For years, Europe has been better known for writing AI rules than for producing AI 
giants. The ASML-Mistral deal points to a bolder vision: pairing Europe’s crown jewel 
in semiconductor manufacturing gear with its most promising AI startup. Is that 
really the case? To be seen. But the three Mistral co-founders have already become 
the first AI billionaires in France. Mistral raised $2 billion in total, with $500 million 
coming from seven other funds and Nvidia—only one of them French. The question 
is whether Europe can combine capital at scale with the dynamism and vision 
needed to compete with the firepower of US and Chinese ecosystems. For the 
skeptics, note that just last week tech funding deals in Europe topped €3.1 billion. 
The old world may still deliver new surprises. The talent is there, what’s missing?

 Novartis bets $1.4B on a cardiovascular biotech 
breakthrough 
↳ Why it matters 
Pharma giant Novartis is acquiring biotech firm  Tourmaline Bio for $1.4 billion, 
securing rights to pacibekitug, a Phase 2 therapy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease (ASCVD), a condition that causes millions of deaths each year worldwide. 
Cardiovascular health, long dominated by statins and lifestyle drugs, may be shifting 
toward more targeted and biologically advanced therapies. This reflects three big 
trends: the rise of precision medicine in tackling chronic diseases, the growth of 
biotech, and big pharma’s strategy to secure pipelines by acquiring agile biotech 
innovators—no news here. 
----------------Page (90) Break----------------
↳ My thoughts on it 
This move highlights how biotech is redefining  the healthcare frontier. Biotech 
investments slowed earlier this year, as I noted in this Snapshot, but the long-term 
trend is undeniable: the sector will grow significantly . Over the next decade, the 
biotech market is expected to nearly triple. It is also a reminder of the symbiosis 
between startups and giants: small biotechs drive the science, big pharma brings it 
to market and scales it. Why? Because Phase 3 clinical trials cost a lot—really a 
lot—and big pharma has distribution channels that would take years and billions for 
a startup to build. From a health system and patient perspective, a key question 
remains: can this model deliver both innovation and affordability?

Weekly Snapshot - Sept 6, 2025 
 
We live in a moment where boundaries blur, science gets politicized, and even the 
climate becomes a stage for venture bets. Some stories feel like glimpses of 
tomorrow breaking into today. Others sound like fiction until they aren’t. 
What happens when shopping skips the search bar, when satellites go dark, or when 
investors start reaching for the sun itself? 
Let’s dive in. 
 The boundaries between the physical and digital are 
blurring, and AR will only accelerate the shift 
↳ Why it matters 
Amazon has just launched Lens Live, an AI-powered tool that lets people point their 
phone at an object in the real world—say, a pair of sneakers on the street—and 
instantly get buying options. It’s the company’s latest attempt to bridge physical and 
digital shopping, and to make the world itself one big catalog. The move puts 
Amazon into a growing race, where Google (with Lens), Snap, and TikTok are also 
experimenting with computer vision shopping. The difference: Amazon controls the 
largest marketplace, logistics network, and payments backbone. If it succeeds in 
making real-world product recognition seamless, the “search bar” could shift from 
text to camera. That’s not just a UX update; it’s a new front in the war for how we 
discover and buy, but also an important clue on the future of interfaces and digital 
experiences. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
----------------Page (92) Break----------------
There’s something fascinating here: for years, e-commerce lived in a parallel world of 
clicks and recommendations, while physical life had its own messy frictions—stores, 
brands, inventory, discovery. Lens Live hints at the collapse of that boundary. 
Imagine walking through a city where every product is instantly “clickable.” Part of 
me sees convenience, part of me sees overload. What’s your take? 
But this is just the beginning. As augmented reality glasses reach the market, the 
very concept of the mobile phone will change—dissolving into new devices (glasses, 
wristbands and more) and unleashing an explosion of applications. Dozens of AR 
glasses projects are expected to reach the market in 2026–2027. The future will tell 
whether what we all expect—an indistinguishable object from ordinary glasses, but 
connected, AI-powered, with real processing power and convincing AR 
capabilities—will be part of that pack or not. Still, the path is clear. What Amazon is 
releasing is a crack through which we can glimpse the future. (By the way... have you

 Yes, we need to look down, up, left, right, back and 
beyond 
↳ Why it matters 
It’s no secret that a major shift is underway in the US and globally. As part of that, the 
US administration is proposing significant   changes to the federal budget—including 
cuts to science and Earth observation programs. Among them are NASA’s Orbiting 
Carbon Observatory missions, which monitor carbon emissions. The justification: 
while OCO-2 and OCO-3 are still functioning well and producing high-quality data, 
----------------Page (93) Break----------------
they were not designed to last this long—and cost-cutting is the priority. The debate 
has quickly become politicized, as reports in the media show. Yet a few facts remain: 
people elect officials to set policy, but making any country great requires science and 
technology. From far away, this seems a mismatch case. Data is essential for 
everything we do—personal decisions, business strategy, waging war or shaping 
policy. Without it, we’re flying blind. Earth monitoring underpins not just policy, but 
also business—NatureTech is a growing field. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The US leads the world in Earth observation. That’s a fact. But if it steps back, others 
will fill the gap–guess who? Many nations understand that climate, weather and 
nature data are vital—and they see the opportunities to innovate and project 
influence globally. The real story here is about today’s global chess game, but also 
about how science can become politicized—a process that history shows intensifies    
during times of societal change or crisis. We are living through such a moment. 
Disbelief and politicization are spreading, and it may take time to reach a new steady 
state. In the meantime, I struggle to understand why the most advanced nation 
would voluntarily give up its edge in science and knowledge. Maybe I’m missing 
something. Ideas? 
That said, this past week Google released the amazing Alpha Planet—worth checking 
out.

 Dimming the Sun: Geoengineering is drawing 
capital, and controversy 
↳ Why it matters 
Venture capitalists are quietly moving into geoengineering—large-scale human 
interventions in Earth’s systems to counter climate change, from reflecting sunlight 
to artificially cooling the planet. Research agencies are paying attention too. This 
isn’t clean energy or circular economy. It’s planetary intervention—high-stakes, risky 
and until recently, unimaginable for most people. As climate tech tightens its belt, 
the pivot to geoengineering marks a shift from prevention to planetary patchwork. 
New business opportunities are emerging and money is starting to flow , but the risks 
of meddling with complex systems are immense. Public opinion remains skeptical. A 
recent Nature survey shows widespread distrust of these technologies and 
government action. The road ahead will be bumpy in our complex and frail world. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
This may sound like a sci-fi  plot, but conversations about geoengineering have been 
happening for decades. I remember debates in Silicon Valley back in 2013. Now, it’s 
coming out of the shadows. On one hand, the Earth is burning and options are 
shrinking. On the other, terraforming is not mitigation—it’s desperation. It addresses 
the effects but should never mean giving up on tackling the cause. What was once 
an extreme niche now involves active companies across Europe—in France, the 
Netherlands, the UK, Spain, Germany—and beyond, in Israel and China. China already 
runs the world’s largest “weather modification ” program with extensive cloud 
seeding. And like everything else, weather can be dual use. Some say the VC push is 
less about cooling the planet and more about owning the thermostat. What do you 
think?

Weekly Snapshot - Aug 31, 2025 
 
We live in a time when change takes many shapes. Sometimes through bold policies, 
sometimes through quiet technologies, and sometimes through societies breaking 
old cycles. 
This week, the signals come from very different corners: an African nation searching 
for a sustainable path from resources to prosperity, a laser technology opening new 
ways to understand and protect nature, and Mexico’s surprising leap in lifting 
millions out of poverty. 
Let’s dive in! 
----------------Page (96) Break----------------
 From opportunity to transformation: Africa in search 
of a model 
↳ Why it matters 
The Maputo International Trade Fair (FACIM) highlighted Mozambique’s push to 
attract foreign investment to create jobs, revive agriculture and rebuild after cyclones 
and ongoing conflict.  The task is daunting—and not unique to Mozambique. The 
country has natural gas, minerals, fertile land, water and young labor, but lacks 
capital, technical know-how (at scale), and large sophisticated business structures. 
Conflict  has already derailed a $20+ billion gas investment by Total. While critical 
resources exist, the capacity to turn them into growth remains limited. Capital looks 
for returns, but if it isn’t available locally there, why would someone choose 
Mozambique over competing opportunities elsewhere? Breaking these 
“non-material” constraints is essential not just for Mozambique, but for much of 
Africa’s development. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
A Mozambican leader said at FACIM: “If we have investment, we can solve all the 
issues.” Yes—but where will the money come from? And more broadly, how can 
developing nations turn resource wealth into sustainable growth? Minerals and 
energy can bring cash, but projects are complex and benefits   quite often don't reach 
beyond a small elite. Investment is oxygen, yet international capital often comes with 
strings, and debt can suffocate—Latin America remembers this well. Africa holds 
60% of the world’s remaining arable land and has a fast-growing population. Aid has 
failed as a path, but a scalable investment model is still missing. Multilaterals should 
help channel private capital into transformative projects. However, my 
non-statistically representative and anecdotal observations in places I know show 
that too often their “private sector” arms back the same safe, low-risk ventures that 
private funds already finance. Is that really their mission?

 Nature: We should know it better 
↳ Why it matters 
MIT Technology Review spotlighted this past week how “Lidar”—an acronym for the 
laser-based mapping tech best known for self-driving cars, meaning light detection 
and ranging—is now being deployed to measure, model and mitigate climate change 
risks, from flood prediction to wildfir e spread. Its precision could help governments 
and insurers prepare better, potentially saving billions in disaster costs. But this is 
just the tip of the iceberg. The truth is that while we know a lot about human and 
consumer behavior (Facebook probably knows more about you than you do, dear 
reader), we know very little about nature and the environments where we live. 
Technology must be used to close this gap. As the climate changes, we will 
increasingly need to understand its impacts on the environment and human 
activities. We also need data to be better prepared to “create value from 
nature”—forests, species, biomes, water sources and more. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
A technology designed for mobility is becoming essential for survival and the 
functioning of the economy at a larger scale. Lidar and similar technologies won’t 
stop disasters, but they can help communities turn surprise into foresight and 
preparedness. Other applications must follow—we need to measure nature to 
prepare, to create value and to preserve. Today, we are losing species we don’t even 
know exist–Imagine you inherit a bundle of things from a wealthy and generous 
----------------Page (98) Break----------------
family member, and you throw it away without even knowing what's inside; would you 
do that? Yet we still lack, at scale, the commercial technologies required to measure 
and understand nature. That is why initiatives such as the XPrize Rainforest are so 
important. As these efforts grow, new business models, companies and even entire 
industry verticals will emerge.I feel tremendously excited about companies in which I 
have directly or indirectly invested, such as YangPlanet and Wyvern. The sustainable 
future—we’ll build it.

 Mexico moves society forward: What is needed to 
take the next step? 
↳ Why it matters 
Mexico recorded a historic drop in poverty, with nearly 9 million people lifted above 
the poverty line since 2018. Social welfare policies, higher minimum wages and 
economic resilience all played a role. The achievement is politically significant   for 
Claudia Sheinbaum’s government and could reshape the narrative of Latin America’s 
fight against inequality. But what is needed to keep that going? The only truly 
sustainable path for countries to move to a higher level goes through maximizing the 
use of their most precious (so far) resource: human capital. To do that, they need to 
train and educate people. To continue this trajectory, Mexico and others must 
simultaneously: (i) train and educate people with quality, speed and scale to avoid 
‘losing the window’; (ii) fund that effort without compromising other critical areas, 
and (iii) do it in a time of massive transformation, when skills are shifting, AI is 
----------------Page (99) Break----------------
shaking the foundations and many jobs are vanishing while others are being created 
in real time. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Inequality in Latin America is tremendous and continues to grow, stressing and 
challenging social cohesion—in Brazil alone, the income of the richest 0.1% rose 
more than five times the general average between 2017 and 2023. While there is 
debate about whether the world is heading toward a “haves vs. have-nots” or “haves 
and have-lots” reality, the fact remains: the lack of investment in human capabilities, 
relative to population potential, is holding back future development. Social policies 
are important, but not enough. Latin America and other parts of the world must 
focus on building stronger, competitive economies—and that is ultimately a function 
of talent. 
Not convinced? Consider this: Brazil graduates about 1.38 million people per year, 
but only around 220,000 in STEM—I know other areas matter, but let's be frank: 
engineers are building the future AI models, computer chips and chip fabrication 
manufacturing that will determine economic fates. China, on the other hand, 
graduates 3.6 million STEM students annually—16 times more, far beyond the 6–7 
times ratio between the two populations. The gap is widening, fast. 
Mexico’s story matters globally: if sustained, it could become a model of inclusive 
development in an era of rising inequality. But only a handful of countries have truly 
succeeded in scaling up quality education and moving citizens from the liabilities to 
the assets column of their social balance sheets. Can Mexico pull that off? How? 
Can AI help? How?

 From Free Markets to Fee Markets: Intel Inside 
Washington 
↳ Why it matters 
Two days ago, the U.S. government crossed a new threshold. After decades of 
advocating free markets, Washington announced it will take a 10% stake in 
Intel—making the U.S. government the main shareholder and turning a cornerstone 
of America’s tech industry into a partial state-owned enterprise. Axios called this 
approach, which among other things includes charging 15% of AMD and Nvidia sales 
abroad, “pay-me capitalism”: subsidies and support tied to strings like equity stakes, 
----------------Page (101) Break----------------
royalties or revenue-sharing–or simply ‘loyalty’ to the administration's agenda. Once 
reserved for bailouts in crises—like the U.S. government takeover of GM in the 
aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when it acquired more than 60% of the “new 
GM”—the U.S. government is now proactively embedding itself in strategic sectors. 
Semiconductors are the opening act... could energy, biotech and space be next? This 
marks a fundamental shift that will impact the U.S. economy and send signals 
across the world—not to mention Intel itself. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
This is a fundamental rewriting of the American economic playbook and, particularly, 
the American narrative. Forget the invisible hand; it is in plain sight now. The state is 
no longer just a regulator or funder; it is again positioning itself as a shareholder, 
with direct influence over industries central to national security and global 
competition. 
Trump got it right: controlling critical technologies—what could be more important 
than semiconductors?—is essential in the geostrategic competition with China and 
beyond. It is also a clear recognition of the limits of the market economy and a 
display of the will of the U.S. administration to command the economy in a very 
visible way. Will it work for the U.S. and Intel? To be seen—make your bets. 
The case may become the emblem of the U.S. ‘adapting’ state-guided capitalism to 
its own context. But the U.S. is not China. And countries across the world are not the 
U.S. China is an extreme case in its capacity to command the economy, with a 
different reality and levers to direct it. The U.S., on the other hand, is exceptional in 
terms of its tech capacity, resources and dynamism—is it immune to government 
intervention?—and the capabilities of its economy. Nevertheless, intellectual 
curiosity aside, what really worries me is how other nations will read this. Others may 
want to copy the model—business, politics and policy love fads and trends—without 
understanding the issues behind it. The American and Chinese governments, despite 
their vast differences, have capabilities, resources and freedom to act in ways that 
----------------Page (102) Break----------------
autarkic and bureaucratic governments, where public and private actors follow 
separate legal regimes, simply do not–yes, I am thinking about a certain nation in the 
tropics. Copying these models will not work in old-fashioned institutional 
environments with obsolete toolkits. Stay alert for what is coming to your own reality 
folks.

 A Burning Reality: Climate Change Costs (and Some 
Opportunities) 
↳ Why it matters 
Europe is burning—literally. Heatwaves have reached record highs across the 
continent, fueling deadly wildfir es and triggering a spike in heat-related deaths. As I 
write this, Spain and Portugal are suffering. And this is just the beginning. Climate 
change is accelerating and will reshape our lives, economies and infrastructures. The 
costs will be enormous. But there are also opportunities—for innovators and 
investors who can bring scalable solutions to reduce hardship or prevent the worst 
outcomes. Still, here is a fact: if Europe is poorly prepared, what about those south of 
the Equator? Who cares? 
↳ My thoughts on it 
----------------Page (103) Break----------------
Sales of Chinese-made (and other) air conditioners in Europe have surged. Midea’s 
sales in France alone jumped 68% year-on-year from 2024 to 2025. The demand for 
AC units in Europe has doubled since 2010, and projections show the number of 
installed units will more than double by 2050 compared to 2019 levels. But ACs need 
power—and Europe’s energy is already expensive. As temperatures rise, so will 
energy demand, public spending and social pressure. The equation is complex: how 
to adapt, ensure well-being and keep economies competitive. Hope you’re staying 
cool—but don’t forget what’s coming.

 The disruption of Economics: We Are Not Equipped 
to Navigate Today's World 
↳ Why it matters 
Two apparently unrelated headlines caught my attention this week. Technology 
economist Carlotta Perez warned of a potential AI bubble, and U.S. Fed Chair Jerome 
Powell signaled a possible shift in monetary policy. These may seem disconnected, 
but they’re likely intertwined. AI has triggered unprecedented levels of capital 
investment in digital infrastructure—yet ROI remains elusive for most firms. At the 
same time, job markets are showing early signs of disruption. Openings for IT roles 
are declining in the U.S., and some companies are already building products without 
coding teams. AI is enabling that. Tech cycles always bring booms and busts—but 
----------------Page (104) Break----------------
this time, the stakes are higher. Job displacement, especially among white-collar 
workers, is coming fast. Forecasting based on past time series won’t help. 
Economics isn’t equipped for this kind of shift. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Unemployment among recent U.S. college grads is now above 6%—higher than the 
4.2% national average. The point: AI is advancing fast, but education systems are 
still training people for yesterday’s jobs. Career promises tied to technical skills are 
no longer delivering. Meanwhile, online influencers inspire millions. For better or 
worse, AI and the internet empower individuals to build and create like never before. 
But most people—and most institutions—are seeing these changes only through the 
rearview mirror. 
Back to jobs, is Powell seeing something that most aren’t—and that data isn’t 
showing yet? Organizations and economies need to level up their strategic 
capabilities, invest in foresight and build a broader understanding of what’s 
unfolding. Few countries and companies have that. Even fewer are aware they need 
it. Buckle up.

 A hacker may be coming for your dreams 
↳ Why it matters 
Physiology’s next great leap is happening inside our heads. Recent research has 
advanced both our ability to “listen to” and “maintain” the brain. A new implant can 
decode a person’s “internal speech” (yes... what you are thinking) with up to 74% 
accuracy, but only after the user thinks of a preset password (ufff...). Using 
CRISPR-based tools, researchers corrected mutations, improved cognition and 
reduced symptoms of devastating brain disorders in mice—bringing brain-targeted 
therapies closer to human trials. The implications range from new treatments for 
neurological disorders—and big business—to a deeper understanding of 
consciousness itself. And yes, pretty soon someone may be able to read your 
dreams. 
----------------Page (106) Break----------------
↳ My thoughts on it 
We are living in an age of technological convergence. New materials and sensors 
can now read data from our brains. AI can help us decode patterns and interpret 
those signals. Synthetic biology—powered by AI and computation—can edit genes 
and re-engineer molecules that interact with the brain. All of this is deeply connected, 
and the impacts will be tremendous. Just think about it—and be mindful. Someone 
may be listening. 
Questions abound. Who owns your dreams? Are you the owner of your thoughts? 
Your mind? Your consciousness? This opens a wide area for work on privacy rights, 
existential rights, and blurs the very notion of the self. What happens when your brain 
is uploaded to an AI? Would that be a clone of you? Would it have will? As we push 
these frontiers, new fields like neural rights are fast emerging.  While this may sound 
far-fetched, the developments we saw just this past week are strong signals that this 
future is much closer than we think. Have you thought about it?

 Countries need solid-grounded future plans 
↳ Why it matters 
The demand for rare earth minerals is soaring. They are essential for manufacturing 
electronics, renewable energy technologies and nearly everything 
computer-related—and the demand will only grow. China controls around 60–70% of 
production and about 90% of refining, giving the country enormous leverage. China 
has learned to coordinate its mining and manufacturing sectors to manage global 
----------------Page (107) Break----------------
flows, just as the U.S. tries to choke China on semiconductors. Rare earths are 
China’s counterweight. 
REMs are a major geostrategic topic, and countries such as Japan are exploring 
ways to increase local supply. Japan recently launched a joint initiative with the 
European Union under which they will pursue joint public–private procurement of 
rare earth elements. At the same time, they are exploring seabed 
production—despite major environmental concerns. This REM rush opens up 
business opportunities: developing new deposits, scaling up refining capacity, 
investing in recycling (where Europe leads), developing technology and even 
exploring sea sources. Expect news, including from outer space. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The 2010 China–Japan incident was an early warning of China’s dominance. Fifteen 
years later, most countries are still unprepared to compete—or to seize the 
upside—but that may be changing. Japan is seeking to secure independence in an 
era where supply chains can be weaponized. This is a pre-emptive strike in the 
resource geopolitics game: diversify supply now, or be vulnerable later. At the same 
time, the U.S., China, Japan and about a dozen more countries are moving on sea 
mining. Europe is doubling down on circular strategies. And players such as Brazil 
are stepping into the refining segment. We’re seeing a deep geopolitical shift, and 
what surprises me is to find a country that does not have a focus on REMs yet.

 Is AI about to eat Europe’s software lunch? 
----------------Page (108) Break----------------
↳ Why it matters 
A wave of powerful new AI models—including OpenAI’s GPT-5 and Anthropic’s 
sector-specific    Claude for financial services—has rattled European markets. Shares 
of companies long seen as frontrunners in AI adoption, such as SAP, Dassault 
Systèmes, LSEG, Sage, and Capgemini, fell sharply this week. The worry? These 
general-purpose and specialized AI models may undercut traditional software and 
data providers, even in markets where Europe has had an edge. While broader 
indices like the FTSE 100 and STOXX 600 held steady, investors are recalibrating, 
questioning whether these firms can adapt fast enough to stay competitive in a 
rapidly shifting AI landscape. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The AI train isn’t just coming—it’s already in the station, and it’s moving fast. 
Companies that built their advantage on proprietary data or industry-specific   
software now face a new reality: general-purpose AI models are moving into their 
territory. Those that see AI as a threat may get left behind; those that see it as a 
co-pilot could turn this disruption into a growth engine. The question is, who has the 
capabilities to do that? This is a moment of strategic clarity—adapt or be overtaken. 
The gap between winners and losers in the AI economy is about to widen 
dramatically.

 3D printing on the Moon is coming. Who will build 
first? 
↳ Why it matters Last Friday, Chinese researchers made the news in Western media 
with a solar-powered device that concentrates light and melts lunar regolith (moon 
dirt), which can then be used to 3D print objects, structures and infrastructure on the 
Moon. Establishing a permanent presence on the Moon is a challenge, and existing 
solutions require transporting building materials from Earth. When operational, 
devices using this new technology could significantly  lower the cost and complexity 
of building habitats on the Moon. The country that masters it will have an edge in the 
race for the Moon. We may have just had a glimpse of a cornerstone for sustained 
lunar presence, moving from idea to prototype. 
↳ My thoughts on it Space is a major frontier for exploration, tech development, 
business and geopolitical competition. The technological offshoots of space 
programs are well-documented, and countries that succeed in space exploration can 
build a competitive edge. But all space-related activities are risky and 
capital-intensive. At its height, the Apollo Project accounted for 2.2% of the U.S. 
federal budget. Not many countries can have big, bold ambitions in space. Although 
India has succeeded in putting in place the most cost-effective program in the 
----------------Page (110) Break----------------
world—kudos to them—that is the exception and, in any scenario, being 
cost-effective is imperative. When we think about scale in space activities, logistics 
is key. At Seldor Capital, we mapped critical needs for space—storing data, 
processing data, manufacturing goods, building infrastructure. Solutions that enable 
these capabilities while skipping logistics from Earth will be big wins.

 GPT-5 takes UX to a new level. But we are still just in 
the beginning. 
↳ Why it matters OpenAI has officially launched GPT-5, its most advanced language 
model yet, positioning it as a general-purpose expert in writing, coding, health, math 
and more. GPT-5 consolidates multiple models under one intelligent system with a 
real-time router that chooses between fast responses and deep reasoning depending 
on the task. It dramatically reduces hallucinations (by 45–80%) and delivers far more 
factual, reliable output than previous models. Importantly, it introduces new safety 
systems to minimize deceptive or sycophantic behavior, aligning better with purpose 
and truth. It is a big step forward in making AI smoother and more reliable from a 
user perspective—others will follow. But... it is not Artificial General Intelligence. Or is 
it? 
↳ My thoughts on it The seamless blend of speed, accuracy, reasoning and 
adaptability transforms the user experience at every level. Having a single 
----------------Page (111) Break----------------
interface—no model swapping anymore—makes a big difference, doesn’t it? Think 
about the conversations you have with humans: they don’t have hard boundaries 
beyond the knowledge of the person you’re talking to. OpenAI’s intent reflects a 
grander ambition related to AGI. Don’t be surprised—the impacts will be massive for 
white-collar jobs and work, and things are changing as we speak. But let me tell you 
what really surprises me: people in intellectual jobs who are not yet using AI. Why? 
And for how long?

 AI in the Boardroom. Are organizations ready for 
this tech era?
 
↳ Why it matters This past week, new data revealed a sharp shift in how corporate 
boards are managing AI. According to Ernst & Young’s proxy-season review, the 
number of S&P 500 companies disclosing AI oversight committees more than tripled 
in 2025, with nearly half of Fortune 100 boards now citing AI as a required 
qualification  for directors (up from 26% in 2024). Meanwhile, a report from 
AuditBoard warns that AI deployment is outpacing governance, with only 25% of 
organizations having fully implemented AI governance programs despite widespread 
AI use. These dynamics show boards scrambling to catch up, but not necessarily 
keeping pace effectively. As in other areas of management, the big issue is how to 
address the challenge and improve performance without inflating costs or 
----------------Page (112) Break----------------
jeopardizing results. Simply adding AI governance structures will hardly be the 
answer. 
↳ My thoughts on it We’re witnessing boards wake up to the strategic urgency of AI, 
but execution is still nascent, and the usual risks of building structures and copying 
management practices without truly strategizing or understanding the situation are 
always present. None of this is new in business. What is new is the unprecedented 
speed of change. It’s not enough to name committees; boards must embed AI 
fluency into decision-making, accountability frameworks and risk monitoring—but all 
of this will only make sense as part of a broader strategic approach powered by 
effective organizational solutions. In a week, the headlines change—the AI headlines 
won’t vanish, though; it’s here to stay—and shortsighted solutions will not suffice.  In 
times of fast-paced change, strategic capabilities have never been more important.

 Making advanced computer chips: a feat far from 
easy 
↳ Why it matters 
Semiconductors are essential in today's world. TSMC alone produces at least 90% of 
the world’s most advanced chips, all concentrated in Taiwan. Any disruption—a war, 
earthquake or pandemic—would impact the entire world. The U.S. is working to 
rebuild local manufacturing capacity but that is far from easy. This past week, U.S. 
Secretary Scott Bessent noted how difficult  it has been to get TSMC’s $42 billion 
Arizona project operational, pointing to local and state regulations (and they are 
enforced) as obstacles. Building advanced tech manufacturing at scale is a long and 
complex process and the basics of competitiveness matter. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Taiwan is an extraordinary success story and TSMC is its symbol. From agriculture 
to a global tech powerhouse, Taiwan was built on investment in talent and science 
and the build-up of business capabilities. I saw it first-hand visiting ITRI, TSMC, and 
working with ITRI colleagues. Bessent’s comments are a reminder: high tech is not 
just about labs. You need talent, infrastructure, and a low-friction business 
environment, especially in a time of fast-paced change. Also: balancing regulation, 
citizen protection, and competitiveness is tough—my take: AI can help a lot. That 
said, the U.S. 20% tariffs imposed on Taiwan this past week sent TSMC’s stock 
plunging. Planned? Thought through? In an increasingly complex world, many things 
seem not quite right.

 AI is hungry and privacy is dead: most people didn't 
notice 
↳ Why it matters 
This past week, reports revealed that Google's search engine was indexing content 
provided by individual users on ChatGPT and making it available to others searching 
the web. In the same week, the NYT announced it had reached an agreement with 
Amazon, allowing the tech giant to feed NYT's content into its LLM in exchange for 
an annual fee of $20 million. AI is hungry. Media platforms are worried – a few, like 
the NYT, are making deals. In the meantime, ChatGPT users were accidentally 
making their private conversations discoverable by search engines such as Google, 
turning personal dialogues into public web results. Sensitive content including 
therapy-style exchanges, resumes, emails, and even internal corporate insights 
surfaced via Google searches. Most people have not noticed (have you?), but privacy 
is a mirage in today's world. And asymmetries in the relationships with tech giants 
are significant.  
↳ My thoughts on it 
AI runs on data—period. And that data comes from everywhere. Those fine-print 
terms we rarely read when signing up for services? That’s often where we give 
permission for our data to be used. In reality, we share personal details—our work, 
habits and even family information—across countless platforms. Two things are 
worth keeping in mind. First, we will increasingly see fights and deals related to data 
access. Surely, that will happen in the B2C world. Second, data privacy as we once 
knew it is largely gone. With so many platforms and ways for data to be sold, 
licensed or leaked, control is nearly impossible. Most people don’t fully grasp the 
business models behind the services they use. Increasingly, these models revolve 
around turning our data into a product.

 Look up and check what is new in 
telecommunications 
↳ Why it matters 
Mobile data traffic  is expected to grow 17% annually through the end of the decade. 
To support this, infrastructure must expand. Starlink is already providing cell phone 
connectivity from low orbit. Chinese companies such as Geespace are testing low 
and high-orbit satellites. And just this week, SoftBank announced it will test airships 
operating at 20 km altitude to deliver connectivity in Japan–the business model is 
still unclear, but this is a new frontier. Infrastructure is not only a strategic asset for 
nations but also a massive business opportunity. Developing the technologies, 
companies and capabilities to deploy and operate such infrastructure could define  
the next decade—and Asia is moving fast as it did with 5G. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
In an increasingly bifurcated world, where China dominates critical areas from 
minerals to infrastructure, most innovations in connectivity are still emerging from 
Asia, not the West. Scale and population explain part of it, but there is more behind 
the curtain. Why aren't more Western companies engaged in this game? Is it about 
market failures? A lack of strategy and vision from Western nations? We are still at 
the beginning of this race, but a future with bifurcated digital infrastructures—one 
largely Western, one Asia-led—should not surprise anyone.

 From water to bits: China builds a mega-dam to 
power AI 
↳ Why it matters 
This past week, China has officially begun building what will be the world’s largest 
hydropower dam, deep in the Tibetan plateau, on the Yarlung Tsangpo river. The 
project—expected to cost $167 billion—would surpass the Three Gorges Dam and 
generate three times more energy. But it’s not just about electricity. The river flows 
into India and Bangladesh, meaning China’s control over it raises geopolitical, 
----------------Page (117) Break----------------
environmental, and humanitarian alarms. India fears the dam could become a “water 
bomb,” while Bangladesh has requested transparency. For Beijing, this is a strategic 
energy move. For its neighbors, it’s an existential threat. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Vladimir Putin once said that “whoever controls AI will control the world." This case 
adds a regional layer—with potential global consequences—to the equation: whoever 
controls the flow  of water from the Tibetan plateau holds immense geopolitical 
power. China and its neighbors know it. With this project, the long-contested Tibetan 
territory gains highlighted relevance—regionally and globally. Water is becoming the 
new oil in Asia, and this megadam may set a dangerous precedent. In a world 
already shaped by energy and AI disputes, competition (and wars...) over water may 
also be on the rise.

 Money Dries Up for Biotech in California — A Great 
Time to Invest (Wisely) 
↳ Why it matters 
Biotech in the San Francisco Bay Area is undergoing a downturn: widespread layoffs, 
company closures and tanking valuations are now commonplace. The Nasdaq 
Biotechnology Index has tumbled nearly 30% in 2025, and nearly 60% of biotech 
firms reportedly have less than two years of funding runway. Combined with cuts to 
NIH support and tightening venture capital, this downturn may delay key drug 
developments and reshape the innovation ecosystem. But... this is also a great 
opportunity to invest! Pay attention! 
↳ My thoughts on it 
----------------Page (118) Break----------------
Biotech is a high-risk, high-return, high-volatility industry—where else do you find a 
stock jumping almost 4,000% in a single day? It’s also deeply connected to science 
investment. Promising pipelines now risk death by financial attrition... and here is a 
big opportunity for those who are cashed in and have the capabilities to assess 
teams and their portfolios. 
This reality also underscores how policy shifts around public research funding can 
ripple through the innovation chain and impact the entire sector. But look—a HSBC 
report released about two weeks ago highlights that “the number of funding deals 
involving drug candidates from China continued to climb, meanwhile...” Wow! What 
does this mean? Here’s one hypothesis: biotech has a really loaded cost structure in 
the US—high salaries, fancy offices,  long and expensive clinical trials, huge 
compliance costs. Startups coming from other markets can look more attractive to 
investors right now. It doesn’t have to be China. Think Australia—with amazing talent 
and an integrated regulatory environment with the US—or Brazil, which has 
world-class science talent eager for opportunities to create global value. It may be 
time to think differently and globally.

 Don't See Them? Look again. 
↳ Why it matters 
A wave of government initiatives, robotics deals and product launches around the 
world this past week signaled a shift: robots are here to stay. Japan deployed robotic 
trainers for Olympic athletes. Germany launched new public-private robotics 
----------------Page (119) Break----------------
coalitions. And in the U.S., autonomous warehouse systems powered by AI secured 
massive expansion deals. Robotics is moving beyond labs into the real 
economy—across sectors, industries and application areas. Interoperability 
standards are also emerging and being adopted by major players. The question is no 
longer if automation will reshape work—it’s how fast, and who controls it. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
We’re crossing from robotics as spectacle to robotics as critical, daily-life 
infrastructure. For all the buzz around AI models and digital platforms, physical 
automation—robots that sense, move and adapt—is where most of the progress is 
happening now. Governments (not all...) are taking notice, embedding robotics into 
industrial policy and workforce planning. Not many countries have both the research 
capabilities and business structures needed to create the global robotics business of 
the future. Those that do should not waste time. Just like with energy or AI, the 
geopolitics of robotics will be shaped by who builds, who supplies and who governs.

 Japan: showing us how to scale innovation globally? 
↳ Why it matters 
Dentsu, the Japanese marketing and advertising giant, inaugurated its new 
innovation lab in India this past week, expanding its global tech footprint. The lab will 
focus on creative AI, digital consumer behavior and hyperlocal personalization. 
Three key trends are at play: India offers scale, technical expertise and creativity that 
can serve global clients; consulting and professional services are increasingly 
blurring with tech development, delivery and deployment; and this marks a new wave 
of Japanese corporate expansion. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Dentsu’s move underscores how a global firm  can tap into Indian tech and talent not 
just for execution but for strategic experimentation in fields like AI and localized 
media. Not many companies or countries are ready to do that, and this can be a real 
competitive advantage. But as noted here a few weeks ago, Dentsu is not alone in 
betting on innovation in India. Japan and Japanese companies often move under the

 China: are EVs entering the M&A lane? 
↳ Why it matters 
President Xi Jinping publicly warned against “involution” in China’s tech 
economy—specifically     , the overconcentration of resources into AI and electric 
vehicles in the same provinces. His message signals several things. First, it directly 
questions the industrial development strategy the country has been pursuing. 
Second, it puts pressure on provinces to innovate and reinforces the ongoing 
competition among them. Third, it suggests that overcompetition in verticals such as 
EVs may have reached a limit, with companies now operating on thin margins. A 
wave of M&As may be coming—will Chinese government funds back them? 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Economies are complex and multi-layered systems. President Xi is sending different 
messages to stakeholders operating at various levels—company, industry, province 
and national policy. Managing competitiveness seems to be the key issue. That said, 
China and the United States share a trait that many people and analysts miss: they 
are competitiveness-oriented nations. That’s very different from what we see in 
----------------Page (122) Break----------------
Europe, Latin America or Africa. Of course, how this ‘competitiveness orientation’ 
manifests, its dynamics and the tools each country has to advance it differ greatly.

 Superbabies: are we ready for them? 
↳ Why it matters 
Health is a frontier in rapid transformation. Recent news from Orchid Health and 
Nucleus highlights how genomics, AI and biology are converging to unlock new 
possibilities. We're just at the beginning. Expect new industries, major investments, 
breakthroughs and plenty of debate. But as we advance, deep ethical questions will 
emerge—especially around editing and enhancing human DNA. This will inject 
enormous complexity into an already turbulent world. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
I believe most of us would fix a genetic issue if it meant protecting our children from 
disease—and that’s entirely understandable. But once enhancement becomes 
possible, inequality could take on a whole new dimension. The wealthy already have 
more resources, education and access. Add engineered biology to that, and the 
divide becomes genetic. Does that sound strange or frightening? 
Until now, genetics has been a level playing field. That may be coming to an end. 
Just think: advanced economies already differ from the least developed ones in 
terms of capital availability, institutional quality, stocks of capabilities (in 
manufacturing, design, research, finance, marketing, etc.), the ability to provide 
quality education and, ultimately, talent pools. Genetics has not been part of that 
----------------Page (123) Break----------------
divide—yet. But that could soon change. Radically. Are we ready for that? And if not, 
how do we prepare?

 We are at the verge of a bio-knowledge explosion 
↳ Why it matters 
We are entering the era of a bio-knowledge explosion. Since decoding the human 
genome in 2003, progress in health hasn’t matched the expectations many had—but 
----------------Page (124) Break----------------
that’s about to change. A convergence of genomics, AI, synthetic biology and 
computing is now unlocking breakthroughs. This past week, news from China broke 
about scientists identifying the gene set that enables complex tissue regeneration 
and manipulating it to switch on the regenerative capacity of tissue—a trait that 
salamanders have but mammals do not. Add to this the race to model “virtual cells,” 
as featured in Nature a few days ago, and you can sense a shift: we’re moving from 
sequencing life to simulating and engineering it. The explosion of bio-knowledge and 
its applications will revolutionize health, biology and possibly even our definition of 
life. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Yes, humanity has made a lot of progress. But... from the heights of the ignorance on 
the matter conferred to me by my engineering education, I’ve long seen medicine as 
powerful but still primitive. False positives, misdiagnoses, limited understanding of 
cellular machinery—we know so little yet about how we and life work. Now, the 
fusion of high-performance computing (quantum soon to be added to the list), 
genomics (and other ‘omics’), advanced visualization tools (for instance, a BSL-4 
biolab connected to a particle accelerator), AI and advanced biotech tools like 
CRISPR is opening a window into the engines of life. We are just scratching the 
surface of this revolution. What’s coming next? A real explosion of biological 
knowledge—and with it, a transformation in how we understand, manipulate and 
design life itself.

 The next unicorn can be.... you! 
↳ Why it matters 
Base24, a (quasi) solo-founded startup just 6 months old, was acquired by Wix for 
$80 million in cash. The product? A code-based site editor designed for developers. 
This isn’t just a flashy exit—it sends signals about two key trends. First, vibe coding 
(haven’t heard about it?? OMG... you’re really late... but you can ask ChatGPT, Gemini, 
Claude and others about it) is here to stay and will accelerate fast in the months to 
come. We’re heading toward a dev world dominated by tools that blend no-code 
simplicity with dev-level control. Developers as we know them will be the exception, 
not the rule. Second, Sam Altman's vision for a one-person unicorn is getting closer 
and closer to materializing. It’s coming. It will come. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Base24’s story reveals a new kind of gold rush: tools that speak developer but move 
like no-code. AI is giving a lot of people the power to build, test and scale digital tools 
like never before. The productivity level of developers has increased... maybe even 
10X. The flip side: as you read this, dev jobs are evaporating. This is not just a trend 
but a tsunami. The good news—and I firmly believe this—is that we will soon see the 
truly one-person unicorn Sam Altman talked about. How soon? To be seen. But... that 
one person could be you! Have you thought about it? What will you do about it?

 Robotics is reaching a turning point 
----------------Page (126) Break----------------
↳ Why it matters 
Robotics is moving into a new era. On different fronts, enabling technologies are 
reaching a turning point. The most obvious is computation and control. Earlier this 
year, Nvidia launched AI processors to power robotics. This past week, Google made 
news with its first fully cloud-free AI model for robotics, capable of running locally 
without depending on the internet or external servers. We reported here in this 
snapshot about tech that could emulate muscles for robots. A few weeks ago, a 
team of researchers from New York University posted a preprint paper introducing 
“e-flesh, ” a technology that has the potential to give robots the tactile sensing 
capability they lack—think a skin for robots. It's coming. Amazingly functional 
humanoid robots will be around sooner than many expect. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
What comes to your mind when you think about a robot? For most people, it’s 
sci-fi-lik e images (yes, most of them will materialize). For those with some 
manufacturing or business experience, maybe industrial robots—those were the first 
ones I actually saw. But where have we all seen robotic capabilities advancing and 
entering daily life in recent years? Robotics is about sensing, processing information 
and acting in the physical world in a controlled way. So, think of this: robot cars are 
robots! Aha! They’re just a special case of robotics. The technology has been 
evolving for quite some time—I first rode in a driverless car in 2013 and was amazed. 
It was—and still is—impressive. A few years later, I rode in Uber’s driverless cars. 
Again, impressive—and robot cars are now out there in the urban wild in many cities 
across the world. We’re a short ride away from a new reality and opportunities 
abound for deeply technical teams and entrepreneurs. Speed and boldness will be 
critical in seizing them. A big shout-out to the NYU folks, who I believe have already 
incorporated e-flesh.

 Deep Tech in the U.S. in 2025: $60.2B and Counting 
----------------Page (128) Break----------------
↳ Why it matters 
According to Tracxn, U.S. deep tech startups have raised a staggering $60.2 billion 
so far in 2025—about two-thirds of all 2024 funding. This surge spans AI 
infrastructure, quantum computing, and space tech. VC investment in deep tech isn’t 
just rebounding—it’s accelerating. 2024 already surpassed the record levels of 2021, 
and 2025 is on track to set a new high. The reason is simple: those who control the 
foundational technologies that enable everything else we ‘see’ will shape the future. 
And we’re not talking about ride-hailing apps (though I love those too), but 
breakthroughs in materials, biology, hardware, computation and energy—think 
nuclear fusion. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The numbers signal more than just economic optimism—they reflect how deep tech 
is being repositioned as strategic infrastructure. From national security to supply 
chain resilience, VCs and policymakers are converging around a new belief: if 
software ate the world, deep tech will rewrite its rules. We’re living in an era where 
businesses and governments are increasingly aligned. Have you noticed that? To my 
Brazilian friends: U.S. VC investment in deep tech so far in 2025 is 20 times greater 
than the total VC investment in Brazil in all of 2024. The overall U.S. VC market is at 
least 100 times larger than Brazil’s. That said... what a great time to invest—right 
now, as you read this!

 Iran-Israel Send Signals to the World 
↳ Why it matters 
This week’s escalation in Iran-Israel tensions is rippling through global markets: oil 
prices are rising, stocks are volatile, and safe havens like gold and the dollar are 
----------------Page (129) Break----------------
gaining. Beyond the financial noise, it's a wake-up call that we are living in a different 
world. Instability and the use of force are becoming the norm, and hopes for a 
rules-based global system are fading. Markets, companies, and nations are largely 
unprepared for this new era. In case you haven't noticed: there's a global race to build 
strategic capabilities. There is no time to wait. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
For all our talk about decoupling and resilience, the global system is becoming 
increasingly fragile. It’s worth watching—not just through a market lens, but from a 
systems-thinking perspective. But be careful not to get trapped by outdated 
stereotypes. For instance, did you know that 70% of university graduates in STEM 
fields in Iran are women? In Saudi Arabia, it’s 60%! Weren’t these the countries where 
women supposedly had few opportunities? In a world growing more complex, it’s 
time to challenge old assumptions—and maybe question what you read in 
mainstream media.

 Japan Bets on India’s Deep Tech Potential 
↳ Why it matters 
Japanese VC BeyondNext has launched a $50M fund to support Indian deep tech 
startups in AI, robotics, and semiconductors. This move is more than just capital—it 
signals a rise in tech diplomacy across Asia and Africa, as India strengthens its role 
as a regional deep tech hub amid U.S.–China tensions. Japan, often overlooked by 
----------------Page (130) Break----------------
Western analysts, has long played the diplomacy game under the radar. But there’s 
another layer here: India’s tough business environment—compared to the U.S. or 
China—limits the value that its world-class scientific   talent can generate. That 
creates opportunities for value creation through strategic knowledge assets 
arbitration. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
This is geopolitical venture capital at work—but also a bet on value creation through 
arbitration. Not sure what that means? Check my LinkedIn article in the links below. 
It’s fascinating to watch how funding flows are redrawing the global innovation map. 
India is emerging not just as a digital and remote talent hub, but as a strategic bridge 
between tech ecosystems. The future of deep tech may not be built in Silicon Valley 
alone—it may be co-created across Mumbai, Tokyo, and beyond. Do you know which 
country produces the highest number of STEM graduates every year? If you’ve read 
this far, the answer won’t surprise you. The real opportunity—across geographies—is 
connecting top entrepreneurial talent with capital and the environments where they 
can thrive.

 Climate-responsive, color-changing paint 
↳ Why it matters 
The development by a U.S. industrial designer of a thermochromic “climate-adaptive” 
paint that shifts hue based on temperature—turning dark in winter to absorb heat and 
light in summer to reflect it—made headlines this past week. The paint reacts above 
approximately 25 °C (77 °F), transitioning from a tinted color to white, and reverses 
as temperatures drop. Heating and cooling of buildings account for around 25% of 
global energy consumption. It is also one of the fastest-growing categories—there 
are 2 billion AC units worldwide, and with rising incomes in emerging nations and 
increasing temperatures, sales are growing at a 6–7% CAGR. Tests suggest this 
----------------Page (132) Break----------------
paint could reduce a building’s heating and cooling energy use by 20–30% annually. 
Do the math, apply a large discount, and you’ll still see how important this could be. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Joe Doucet is a well-known American designer. His design practice, JDXP, claims to 
work at the intersection of design, innovation and sustainability. As someone who 
truly believes in the power of design and the need to solve problems by design, I 
loved this. Where did the inspiration for the “climate-adaptive” paint come from? 
Mood rings, according to them. The paint hasn’t reached the market yet, and its 
durability and cost will need to pass the test of consumer preferences. Above all, this 
case highlights the potential for innovation in materials. Mostly unseen and often 
misunderstood, materials are at the core of today’s economy. With AI, computation, 
synbio and other technologies converging rapidly, we can expect a wave of

 Riders in the sky: the space race heats up 
↳ Why it matters 
The space race is heating up, and new reports this past week point to scenarios that 
key competitors are actively preparing for. Countries like the U.S. and China appear 
to be escalating their readiness for “orbital dogfights,” anticipating hostile satellite 
maneuvers, anti-satellite weapons and drone swarms in orbit. Strategic priorities 
now include protecting satellite networks like Starlink, defending against 
space-based nuclear threats, building orbital missile defenses and responding to 
----------------Page (133) Break----------------
direct threats to assets in space—such as space stations. This marks a pivotal shift: 
outer space is rapidly becoming the next contested domain in great-power rivalry, 
and international law is crumbling before our eyes. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Space warfare used to belong to the realm of science fiction—it doesn’t anymore. 
Life on Earth now depends heavily on space capabilities and assets. Securing 
satellite systems is no longer just a military priority; it’s essential to modern 
society—from banking to disaster response. One reality brought into plain sight by 
the war in Ukraine is the integration of commercial platforms (e.g., Starlink) into 
national defense. Although only a handful of countries have the capacity to address 
this, space security has become a critical issue for nations worldwide. Combined 
with the promise of space mining and the potential for space-based 
biomanufacturing, this will only accelerate the ongoing drive for space exploration 
and the emerging space economy.

 A boom in global carbon-capture investment 
↳ Why it matters 
Sustainability and climate science may no longer feel as fashionable in many parts 
of the world as they did just months ago. Still, governments and enterprises are 
channeling a record $80 billion into carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects by 
2030—a fourfold increase in capacity, according to a new report released last week. 
CCS is emerging as a critical tool to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors like cement, 
steel, and power generation. This surge reflects growing net-zero ambitions ahead of 
COP30, signaling both new investment opportunities and a broader shift from 
----------------Page (134) Break----------------
speculative to scalable climate solutions. Not just climate activists—but especially 
investors—should be paying close attention. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
It’s increasingly clear that the Paris Agreement emission targets won’t be met. If 
cutting emissions isn’t enough, can carbon storage become a scalable business? 
Momentum is growing. Nature still offers the best carbon capture method, but 
scaling NBS projects—especially in the Global South—faces some serious social and 
institutional barriers. CCS is advancing faster, in part because it avoids those 
constraints. Still, investment tells a story: in 2024, VC funding for energy tech was 
just a third of what went into AI—down from parity in 2023. And what do we do with 
captured carbon? Companies like Cemvita have answers. Interestingly, Occidental 
Petroleum—featured in the CCS report that sparked this post—is also backing 
Cemvita.

 The US-China Tech War Goes Deeper 
↳ Why it matters 
This week, Synopsys, a leading U.S. chip design software firm, ordered its China 
teams to halt all sales and services, suspending new orders. The decision follows 
fresh U.S. export controls on chip design tools and semiconductor materials, 
targeting Chinese clients, local staff of global firms, and military-linked users. 
Together with Cadence and Siemens EDA, Synopsys controls over 70% of China’s 
chip design software market. Cutting access further strains China’s semiconductor 
industry, already under pressure from earlier sanctions. The move escalates the 
U.S.-China tech conflict  and sends a broader warning: relying on foreign technology 
in critical areas can pose serious risks. Few countries can build local 
alternatives—many wish they could. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
----------------Page (136) Break----------------
This feels like another chess move in the long game between Washington and 
Beijing. It’s hard to strike a balance, as restrictions like these don’t necessarily stop 
innovation—they often accelerate domestic alternatives. Timing is key. Chinese EDA 
firms like Empyrean and Primarius are gaining momentum, and reports of pirated 
EDA software are surfacing too. And let’s be honest: China was expecting this. It’s 
almost certain they’ve been ramping up investment and support for indigenous 
players, and I wouldn’t be surprised if they have an ace up their sleeve. Synopsys will 
likely take a short-term hit—China represented a significant   share of its revenue. 
Who’s going to absorb that loss? But the long game remains uncertain, and 
outcomes are hard to predict—place your bets. Right now, every tool, every line of 
code, is a battleground.

 Pride Month 2025: Corporate Support (and Values) 
Wanes 
↳ Why it matters 
Pride events across the U.S. are facing major budget gaps this year as corporate 
sponsors pull back. A Gravity Research survey shows that 39% of companies plan to 
scale down public Pride Month support, fearing backlash over DEI initiatives. Cities 
like San Francisco and New York report shortfalls of up to $750,000. Companies 
including Comcast, Anheuser-Busch and PepsiCo have cut or ended support, citing 
political pressure and rising anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment under Trump. Some now donate 
anonymously. Pride groups are turning to grassroots fundraising to fill the gaps. Free 
market? Here’s the truth: companies are highly sensitive to the political 
environment—and, with a very few exceptions, they bend to the will of the powers 
that be. 
----------------Page (137) Break----------------
↳ My thoughts on it 
The withdrawal of corporate sponsorships from Pride events is a stark reminder of 
how fragile corporate values really are. In most cases, they’re nothing more than 
empty PR—pure performance, total BS. To be fair, the U.S. government is incredibly 
powerful, and navigating the political landscape isn’t easy for any company. That 
said, as Pride events return to their grassroots origins, two key questions emerge. 
First, can individuals step up and keep the momentum alive? Second, can a cause 
stay strong when it becomes dependent on corporate funding to survive?

 Ukraine's Drone Offensive Redefines   Modern 
Warfare 
↳ Why it matters 
On June 1, 2025, Ukraine executed "Operation Spiderweb," a meticulously planned 
drone offensive targeting five Russian airbases deep inside Russian territory. 
Utilizing 117 first-person view (FPV) drones launched from concealed trucks within 
Russia, the operation reportedly damaged or destroyed more than 40 Russian 
military aircraft, including strategic bombers such as the Tu-95, Tu-22M3 and A-50 
airborne early warning and control planes. Some analysts estimate the attack 
caused around $7 billion in damages and compromised roughly 34% of Russia’s 
strategic cruise missile carriers stationed at airbases. This unprecedented strike not 
only demonstrated Ukraine’s growing capabilities in asymmetric warfare but, more 
importantly, revealed the transformative impact of drone technology and a 
fundamental shift in the nature of warfare: attacking has become much cheaper than 
defending. 
----------------Page (138) Break----------------
↳ My thoughts on it 
How do you protect a $2 billion B-2 Spirit from 1,000 drones that cost just $2,000 
each? The successful use of low-cost, commercially available drones to incapacitate 
high-value military assets marks a turning point in modern warfare. The ability of a 
smaller nation or even a non-state actor to inflict serious damage on a much larger 
adversary has reached a new level. From force design to industrial policy, 
fundamental questions are now on the table. This kind of operation not only 
challenges traditional ideas of military superiority, it also serves as a wake-up call for 
nations everywhere to rethink their defense strategies in light of the democratization 
of drone technology. Where do the US, EU and China keep their most valuable 
aircraft? What about other critical assets? I bet many high-ranking officers  in 
advanced economies are staying up all night right now, trying to prepare for 
scenarios they never imagined.

 Water security takes center stage in Astana (and 
worldwide) 
↳ Why it matters 
This past week at the Astana International Forum (AIF) 2025, leaders and experts 
emphasized the urgent need for regional cooperation in Central Asia to address 
water scarcity and climate challenges. Shared rivers like the Syr Darya and Amu 
Darya, which flow  across the region into the Aral Sea, are under growing pressure 
due to inefficient  use, outdated infrastructure and rising demand from agriculture, 
industry and population growth. Water is often taken for granted in wealthier or 
naturally endowed regions, but it is an essential resource that is increasingly in short 
supply. In Kazakhstan alone, 500,000 people lack access to water. The Aral Sea, 
once the fourth-largest lake in the world, has dried up by 92 percent since 1960. The 
lack of water kills, stalls economies and triggers conflict—not just in Central Asia. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
----------------Page (140) Break----------------
The other day I heard from a colleague: “ when water ends, war starts.”. So true. 
Water is Water is essential—especially in geopolitically sensitive regions like Central 
Asia. Consider India and Pakistan: 80% of Pakistan’s drinking and irrigation water 
comes from rivers governed by the Indus Water Treaty with India. Signed in the 
1960s, the treaty has withstood multiple conflicts  but was challenged by India during 
recent clashes. Globally, 1.1 billion people lack access to safe water, and 2.7 billion 
face water scarcity for at least one month each year. Water isn’t just about drought 
or irrigation—it’s about power, borders and long-term stability. When natural 
resources cross man-made borders, so do the risks. Global freshwater stocks are 
rapidly declining, and 2023 was the driest year for rivers worldwide in over three 
decades. Things are getting hot and the clock is ticking.

 SpaceX speeds toward Mars, but turbulent skies lie 
ahead 
↳ Why it matters 
SpaceX launched its Starship for the ninth time this past week. Despite losing 
contact with the ship, the company is doubling down on its Mars ambitions, aiming 
for an unmanned mission by 2026—just around the corner. Facilities are being 
expanded, teams redeployed, and there’s even talk of sending Tesla’s humanoid 
robot, Optimus. For people like me, the idea of humanity going to Mars is incredibly 
exciting. But beyond the excitement, this also means the flow  of money is 
accelerating. Companies hoping to participate in the emerging new space economy 
----------------Page (141) Break----------------
will need to move fast—developing and deploying products at speed. The train—well, 
the spaceship—is about to leave the station. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Musk is officially out of the U.S. government. The impacts on his businesses remain 
to be seen, but SpaceX continues to sit at the center of not only the global space 
industry but also U.S. strategic priorities. This comes as the new space race gains 
momentum—more than 300 lunar missions are expected within the next decade, and 
high-visibility Mars missions are likely to materialize soon. Mars is quickly becoming 
the next arena for showcasing technological dominance. The potential presence of 
humanoid robots on Martian soil will offer striking opportunities for futuristic 
photo-ops—but it’s more than that. Space tech, AI and robotics are rapidly 
converging. At this point, the question isn’t whether humans will reach Mars—it’s 
whose flag goes up first. What an exciting time in history.

 The tip of the iceberg: Germany proposes 10% tax 
on big tech’s digital dds 
↳ Why it matters 
Germany is drafting a plan to tax 10% of digital ad revenues from tech giants like 
Google and Meta, joining a growing list of countries—including Canada, Austria, the 
UK, France, Italy, Spain, Turkey and India—that have implemented similar measures. 
Traditional German media outlets have praised the initiative. From a German 
----------------Page (142) Break----------------
perspective, this is said to be about leveling the playing field—big tech profits  
significantly  from content generated by others. But all of this is unfolding within a 
complex global landscape. Technology change, business innovation, digital policy, 
global trade, tech dominance, sovereignty, economic competitiveness and 
security—these issues are all deeply connected. What ultimately happens in Europe 
will have far-reaching implications—for big tech, for countries and for individuals like 
you and me. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Let’s be clear: everything digital is tremendously important in today’s world—and 
there’s much more to come. Europe is trying to rein in American tech dominance. 
The EU has already passed a series of digital regulations, with more on the way, 
including the soon-to-be-enacted Code of Practice on General Purpose AI. These 
efforts are being challenged by big tech and the current AI establishment. The stakes 
are high. First, this is part of a multi-trillion-dollar dispute between national 
governments and big tech, with Europe leading the effort to curb the influence of 
tech giants and assert digital tech sovereignty. Second, despite—or perhaps also 
because of—its regulatory push, Europe has lagged behind in digital innovation and 
competitiveness. Third, moves like Germany’s may further strain transatlantic 
relations, especially with the U.S., where most of these companies are based. A 
question to think about: where does digital tech European companies stand in all of 
this? The world is watching.

 Tiny Passengers, Big Changes: The Evolution of 
Spaceborne Life 
↳ Why it matters 
Chinese scientists have discovered a previously unknown bacterial strain aboard the 
Tiangong space station. The new microbe, Arthrobacter changlensis, was isolated 
from a surface sample taken in 2022 and is notably adapted to harsh 
environments—radiation, low temperatures and microgravity. Bacteria in space is not 
new, but this strain appears to have undergone significant   adaptation, developing 
mechanisms to protect itself from the cellular degradation caused by radiation. This 
discovery could provide valuable clues on how to better prepare humans for 
long-haul space missions. 
----------------Page (144) Break----------------
↳ My thoughts on it 
Understanding cellular mutation in space is deeply strategic. As nations race to 
colonize orbital and lunar environments, knowing how life adapts in space isn’t just 
scientific   curiosity—it’s infrastructure planning. The more nations competing in the 
space arena advance their biological space research, the more self-sufficient   and 
sovereign their future off-Earth operations will become. I bet NASA, ESA and others 
are also paying close attention.

 Big Pharma Just Bought Your Family Tree 
↳ Why it matters 
Biotech giant Regeneron is acquiring the bankrupt consumer DNA company 
23andMe for $256 million. The deal includes 23andMe’s genetic database of over 14 
million individuals—including myself. This is one of the largest privately held pools of 
genomic data in the world. While 23andMe failed to sustain its direct-to-consumer 
business, its vast trove of health data is now being absorbed into a pharmaceutical 
R&D engine. Its downfall is a powerful story of how even the ‘best’ and most 
well-resourced companies can become trapped in their own business models and 
fail to adapt. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Health data is the new oil. But monetizing that data isn’t as easy as it once seemed, 
as 23andMe’s downfall shows. With this move, Regeneron didn’t just acquire a failed 
company—it acquired a shortcut to personalized medicine. This is a textbook case of 
vertical integration. 23andMe’s data alone wasn’t enough to generate the cash flow  
----------------Page (145) Break----------------
needed to sustain the company as a standalone operation, but those same data 
assets can (potentially) unlock massive value when integrated into the structure of a 
pharmaceutical giant. The future of pharma won’t be built in labs alone, but in the 
data trails we handed over while spitting into test tubes. And frankly, it wouldn’t 
surprise me if news eventually emerges about the role the U.S. government played in 
catalyzing this deal.

 India’s Next Frontier: Farming in Orbit 
↳ Why it matters 
An Indian astronaut, Sudhanshu Shukla, will soon conduct experiments on growing 
green gram and fenugreek aboard the International Space Station. This initiative 
marks an important step toward sustainable space agriculture, which is essential for 
long-duration missions—a field where significant   progress is unfolding globally. Just 
as important, it reflects another milestone in advancing India’s highly successful and 
cost-effective new space economy. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
What India has achieved in space exploration is remarkable. Among other 
milestones, India built its own GPS-like system, made the first successful landing 
near the Moon’s South Pole, became the first Asian nation to reach Mars and 
deployed Mangalyaan—the cheapest Mars mission ever. That’s a lot. A few years 
ago, they launched NewSpace India Ltd. to scale up the high-tech manufacturing 
base linked to the space program by licensing technology to private companies and 
nurturing the growth of a private-sector-led space economy. Are there any other

 What do you read every day? Why? 
↳ Why it matters 
News emerged this past week that changes in Google and YouTube’s algorithms 
have significantly  reduced the visibility of Turkish independent media and critics of 
Erdoğan’s government. This goes beyond simple SEO tweaking—it raises questions 
about who controls the voices in digital spaces. I’ll tell you a secret: it’s not you who 
chooses what you read. Our choices about the content we consume are mostly 
shaped and controlled by social media algorithms and the interests that govern 
those. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Whether intentional or not, the shifts in Turkey highlight the disturbing concentration 
of power in a handful of platforms that increasingly act as invisible editors of public 
discourse. To be fair, this isn’t new. Traditional media is incredibly concentrated—and 
used to be even more so in the past. Social media platforms are not neutral (by the 
way, nothing in the world is truly neutral); they are driven by economic motives—to 
maximize engagement and profit for the platform—and political motivations, to 
support or undermine certain viewpoints. And let’s be clear—companies aren’t 
neutral either. They have their own interests and often bend to or align with powerful 
ones, in Turkey and everywhere. By the way: why are you reading this?

 Spain's Hispasat Eyes Ukraine’s Frontline 
↳ Why it matters 
Spanish satellite operator Hispasat is considering offering coverage to the Ukrainian 
military. The move comes amid growing concerns that Starlink—currently relied upon 
by Ukrainian forces—may not be as neutral or stable in the long term as hoped. There 
are several intertwined issues here. First, space is a critical frontier—not only for 
innovation and economic development but also for national and global security. 
Second, we live in a time when a company and an individual have more strategic 
capabilities than most, most countries. Third, Europe is waking up to the need for 
greater strategic autonomy, realizing it must take more responsibility for its own 
security and reduce risk in global partnerships and alliances. Fourth, Hispasat is a 
key player in Europe’s space ambitions, serving as one of the leaders of the IRIS² 
satellite constellation project, launched in December 2024. Fifth, Europe is behind in 
space technologies (and in other strategic domains) and is now trying to catch up. 
The Hispasat-Ukraine development is more than a shift in satellite providers—it’s a 
window into Europe’s evolving landscape in space, security and sovereignty. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Space was never neutral, and it certainly isn’t today. The war in Ukraine is the first 
truly internet-powered conflict  at the battlefield   level and has introduced major 
innovations in warfare—think massive use of drones, gamification,  target acquisition 
through geolocation of mobile phones, and more. In that context, when one actor can 
control a battlefield’  s internet switch and old alliances are being tested, it may be 
time to rethink the concept of infrastructure sovereignty. Europe’s push into space is 
not just driven by Brussels or security concerns—it’s also about innovation, business 
and the future economy. German companies like Atmos Space Cargo (had the first 
flight of its Phoenix vehicle in April) and Isar Aerospace (had the first–short–test 
flight of its rocket on March 30), the Paris-based Interstellar Lab (recently announced 
----------------Page (149) Break----------------
its Petit-Prince mission to the Moon) and many others are leading the charge into the 
commercial ‘new space’ sector. Europe has no time to lose when it comes to 
energizing its slow-moving economy.

 UK Bets Big on Geoengineering 
↳ Why it matters 
The UK just allocated £56.8 million to 21 experimental climate interventions—from 
thickening Arctic ice to brightening clouds to reflect sunlight. Once considered fringe, 
geoengineering is entering the mainstream fast, with serious backing and serious 
risks. Is that good or bad? Well... it seems we will need to pursue all possible paths 
and use every tool available if we want to avoid the global disruption caused by 
human-driven climate change. If things continue as they are, the planet is on track 
for a 3-degree-plus increase by the end of the century. Climate and weather respond 
exponentially to changes in global temperature, and the differences between 1.5°C, 
2°C and 3°C scenarios are stark. The world as we know it is unlikely to exist under 
the latter—and extreme measures are increasingly likely to be needed. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
We broke the planet with technology. Now we’re hoping technology can fix it—or at 
least buy us time. The clock is ticking. Honestly, I think most people don’t care: many 
of the rich believe they can escape the chaos, and most of the population has no 
----------------Page (150) Break----------------
idea what’s coming. Remember that movie... Don’t Look Up!? Bad news aside, the 
new initiative by the UK’s Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA) highlights 
two key needs: bold action to fight climate change and bold tools to drive innovation. 
ARIA’s very creation, as mentioned here before, was a response to the urgent need to 
reignite innovation and inject a moonshot mindset into British research. The real 
impact—on both fronts—remains to be seen. Great Britain is an island, and rising sea 
levels will affect it. But no man is an island, and let’s face it: we will all suffer the 
consequences of climate change.

 White Smoke, Global Signals: A New Pope for a 
Fractured World 
↳ Why does it matter? 
On May 8, the Vatican announced the election of Pope Leo XIV, formerly Cardinal 
Robert Francis Prevost of the United States—marking the first time an American has 
ascended to the papacy. This historic choice reflects the Church’s evolving global 
dynamics and the increasing influence of regions outside the traditional European 
stronghold. His background in pastoral care and administrative leadership may 
shape how the Catholic Church addresses contemporary global challenges—from 
social justice to interfaith dialogue and internal reforms—and how it positions itself 
in a world where it has been continuously losing “market share” in the global 
religious landscape. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
This election signifies   more than a change in leadership; it may signal a shift in the 
Church's engagement with the modern world. Prevost's American roots and 
experience suggest a papacy that could be more dynamic, pragmatic and focused on 
impact and engagement rather than stuck in old traditions. Let’s be clear: (1) the 
world is being torn apart by religious divisions—think of the conflict  between 
Pakistan and India, for example—and (2) Catholicism has been losing ground. It will 
be interesting to observe how Leo XIV’s leadership influences  the Church’s stance on 
pressing issues, its approach to the material needs of communities (within 
Christianity, Protestants do this much better) and its role on the international stage. 
It will also be interesting to see how digital will be factored into the future of 
Catholicism. There will be many things to follow.

 AI Regulation: To What Extent Can We Decouple 
Risk and Reward? 
↳ Why does it matter? 
In a U.S. Senate hearing this week, tech leaders like OpenAI’s Sam Altman, AMD's 
Lisa Su and Microsoft's Brad Smith supported a looser, more innovation-friendly 
approach to AI regulation. Senator Ted Cruz proposed a regulatory “sandbox” 
inspired by the freewheeling internet policies of the 1990s. The intention is to keep 
America ahead in the global AI race, especially against China. 
The contrast with Europe's regulatory approach is obvious—and so are the results 
the American economy has shown in comparison. Whoever takes the lead in the AI 
race will gain a major edge globally, set the standards and build the products other 
nations will use. But speed can be destabilizing in social, economic and geopolitical 
terms. A major risk looms: letting the genie out of the bottle before we figure out 
how to deal with truly intelligent—and possibly sentient—algorithms and machines. 
The stakes have never been this high. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Tuning regulatory regimes to support (and not stifle)  innovation while also protecting 
citizens is a tricky but essential task. It’s not new to the world, but it has become 
more critical now. AI is moving really, really fast—we’re seeing it, right? (I'll share a 
personal experience soon)—and companies and countries are making big bets on it.  
Regulatory sandboxes have proven effective in allowing nascent technologies, 
business models and whole industries to develop and grow—from fintech in the UK 
and Brazil to agtech in Australia, from autonomous mobility in Singapore to digital 
----------------Page (153) Break----------------
health in the U.S. Multilateral banks have praised and helped disseminate this model. 
But the details of setting up a sandbox abound: economic and geographic scope? 
Timeframe? Safeguards? 
What many people don’t understand in the whole conversation about AI is the notion 
of competitiveness. Competitiveness is not absolute—it is relative by definition. 
Nations compete for talent, capital, market share and access to resources. Don’t you 
think so? Think about this: in general, if top global talent—I mean it, really top 
talent—doesn’t find capital to build a company or execute a research project in their 
home countries—A, B or C—if they don’t find other qualified   people to work with, and 
if things are hard to get done, they’re likely to move to a different country—like the 
U.S.nAnd don’t forget: water follows the path of greatest potential energy loss (that 
is, the path of least resistance). The same happens with capital and with truly top 
global talent. 
The big question from a U.S. perspective is: what is needed to build and sustain a 
leadership position against China? Institutional models and AI business strategies 
differ between the two nations. And—as Nvidia's Jensen Huang said a few days 
ago—China has 50% of all AI researchers in the world. Will changes in regulation 
alone be enough for the US to beat China? Probably not, it is a system. What will 
come out of this competition remains to be seen. 
But from a broader humanity perspective, the question is different: will we shape AI, 
or will it shape us? The answer is simple—both. The real issue is to what extent each 
of these dynamics will manifest. We are living in absolutely fascinating times, full of 
challenges and opportunities. Much more to come.

 News from the Climate Risk Front: NOAA Halts 
Billion-Dollar Disaster Reports 
↳ Why does it matter? 
The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has announced 
it will stop updating its widely used dataset on billion-dollar climate and weather 
disasters—a tool that has served scientists, journalists, businesses, and 
policymakers for years. This dataset has been a gold standard for tracking the 
financial toll of climate change in the U.S. The announcement came the same week 
Nature published research estimating that the share of the global population 
exposed to extreme weather will double between those born in 1960 and those born 
in 2020. Without robust data, it becomes significantly  harder to manage risk, plan 
investments, and prepare communities for growing climate-related threats. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Climate change is real—and its impacts are being felt through severe weather that 
disrupts lives, businesses and entire communities. The need for climate data is 
urgent and global, as cities and nations must increasingly factor climate-related 
damages into their budgets and planning. While data alternatives may exist—such as 
private datasets maintained by European insurers—it remains unclear whether 
smaller municipalities and companies, particularly those outside the big corporate 
world, will have access to these tools. We must remember that cost of climate 
change doesn’t disappear when we stop tracking it. 
Globally, emerging nations—which aren’t covered in NOAA’s dataset—face even 
greater challenges. Their infrastructure is often fragile, and most are underinvesting 
due to financial constraints. Now, they must redirect resources to deal with 
escalating climate impacts. The gap in capacity between countries with 
$5,000–10,000 GDP per capita and those with $80,000 is staggering when it comes 
----------------Page (155) Break----------------
to absorbing climate-related costs. Do we have any reliable data repositories that 
offer relevant granularity for emerging (or submerging?) economies? This is a time 
when we all need more data—and we should look up (remember the movie?).

 Sea Bass on the moon? Aquaculture enters the 
space race 
↳ Why does it matter? 
European researchers have successfully hatched sea bass eggs in lunar gravity 
simulations, laying the groundwork for potential aquaculture on the Moon. This 
----------------Page (156) Break----------------
innovation is not just a sci-fi  curiosity, it’s a step toward creating sustainable food 
sources for long-duration space missions and eventual lunar bases. Fish farming in 
space could reduce reliance on costly Earth resupplies and help close ecological 
loops in extraterrestrial habitats. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
It’s fascinating to see how climate and space exploration are starting to overlap. The 
same logic driving vertical farms and lab-grown meat on Earth—resilience, efficiency 
and closed-loop systems—is now guiding lunar food experiments. The future of 
space exploration will require us not just to have food production in space but also 
manufacturing, mineral extraction, power generation, data storage, data processing 
and much more. That said, if you are interested in food and space, check out

 A big shift in a shifting world 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Last week, the U.S. administration released its “skinny budget” proposal for FY2026. 
While it’s an early outline, it offers a glimpse into the administration’s evolving 
priorities and comes at a time of global flux and intensifying competition. One 
striking element is the proposed 56% cut to the National Science Foundation’s 
budget. That matters—first,    because countries like China and others continue to 
ramp up investment in science, technology and innovation. And second, because the 
folks behind the proposal (I sincerely believe) are aware of the importance of 
investments in science and technology. If that holds, the only explanation for the 
----------------Page (157) Break----------------
proposed changes is that they assume the U.S. research and innovation model must 
change and are trying to catalyze that. That assumption is bold and carries risks. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Over the years, the competitive position, economic power and global influence of the 
U.S. have been fueled by a powerful combination: abundant capital, a deep 
entrepreneurial drive, a sophisticated and large domestic market and a remarkable 
pool of science, technology and business talent. Much of that talent came not just 
from within but from around the world, in search of opportunities they didn’t find in 
their countries. The U.S.—like China in many ways—has thrived on scale, ambition 
and a relentless push for competitiveness. It will be very interesting to see what 
results the shifts now underway will have on the U.S. economy. Will a new, more 
efficient and high-performing system emerge—one that reimagines research and 
innovation models for a new era? Or will this mark the decay of the golden goose of 
science and innovation? The stakes are high. The world will be watching.

on the moon

development aims to provide a reliable energy source for sustained lunar exploration 
----------------Page (158) Break----------------
and research activities. It highlights the strategic and growing importance of space 
in global geopolitics while underscoring the fact that a race to space will necessarily 
be a race to develop the supply of energy and power in space. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Learning about this, I can't stop thinking about For All Mankind, one of my favorite TV 
shows. Infrastructures are essential, and nations that have the capacity to deploy 
them at speed—on Earth and beyond—can gain a competitive edge. As the global 
geopolitical competition between the US and China gains momentum, a focus on 
energy infrastructure like this will be crucial for long-term presence and exploration. 
The space race is also a race for influence. As of today, 54 countries have signed the 
Artemis Accord. Interestingly, China is promoting its 555 plan for space exploration: 
55 countries, 500 research institutions, 5,000 researchers. A day after Chinese 
officials commented on the nuclear power plant, news emerged that the first 
non-Chinese astronaut to go to Tiangong will be from Pakistan. Competition drives 
innovation, but... will we also have room for cooperation?

  India Suspends Indus Waters Treaty After Kashmir 
Attack 
↳ Why does it matter? 
On April 24, 2025, India suspended its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) 
following a deadly militant attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, which killed 26 tourists. The 
IWT, signed in 1960, has been a cornerstone of India-Pakistan relations, facilitating 
water sharing from the Indus River system. India's decision marks a significant   
escalation, as the treaty had withstood two wars between the two nuclear-armed 
countries. Pakistan has labeled the suspension an "act of war" and called for a 
neutral probe into the attack. This development threatens regional stability, as both 
nations are nuclear-armed and have a history of conflict  over Kashmir. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
While intended as a punitive measure against alleged Pakistani support for 
cross-border terrorism, the move risks undermining a long-standing mechanism that 
has managed to function amidst hostilities. The potential for miscalculation is high 
----------------Page (160) Break----------------
but, in practice, there are many doubts about whether India can truly stop the river 
from flowing into Pakistan. To compound and further complicate the situation, China 
is upstream from India on various watercourses. In any scenario, this is a clear 
display that water matters (a lot) and can be weaponized. We are likely to see more 
of this in a turbulent world under the pressure of climate change.

  23andMe's Bankruptcy: business and geopolitics 
get mixed 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Genetic testing company 23andMe, currently undergoing bankruptcy proceedings, 
may face national security scrutiny if it sells its assets to a foreign entity, according 
to a court filing by U.S. national security agencies. The interagency Committee on 
Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) warned that any sale involving 
foreign buyers, particularly from countries like China, Russia or Iran, may be subject 
to review or prohibition if it threatens national security. The company holds genetic 
data for 15 million consumers and was a pioneer in direct-to-consumer DNA testing. 
Its failure is emblematic and, beyond the super relevant business case itself, carries 
significance  in the current global geopolitical scenario. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
23andMe was founded by Anne Wojcicki, someone at the top of the food chain in 
Silicon Valley—raised on the Stanford campus and Sergey Brin's ex-wife. This is not 
an ordinary company at all. How could it fail? Pretty standard: they struggled to 
generate recurring revenue and failed to diversify into other sources; to compound 
the situation, a data breach and regulatory friction did not help. All of that is easy to 
understand. But what really matters is history repeating itself: despite all the money, 
----------------Page (161) Break----------------
connections, talent they recruited and business acumen, they failed—it is really hard 
to see and change things when you are inside a situation. And now, geopolitics limits 
their options, a scenario that was not visible in 2013 when I was in California and 
received a 23andMe kit as a gift. Businesses now have new factors to compute

  Poxiao: China's Breakthrough in Flash Memory 
Speed 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Chinese researchers at Fudan University have developed "Poxiao," a flash memory 
device capable of erasing and rewriting data in just 400 picoseconds—a picosecond 
is one trillionth of a second. This invention is approximately 100,000 times faster 
than conventional flash memory and could significantly  impact AI computing and 
data storage by reducing latency between memory and processing units. The 
technology has the potential to reshape the semiconductor industry and computers 
as we know them. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The development of Poxiao represents a significant   leap in memory technology, 
potentially bridging the gap between storage and processing speeds. If the 
technology performs at scale, we could see two things happening. First, new 
computer architectures will emerge and the difference between RAM and storage 
units is likely to disappear—everything would become flash memory. Second, China 
could gain an edge in a critical subdomain of the semiconductor industry. However, 
challenges remain in mass production. Let's keep an eye on this and see how it 
evolves.

 Intel Restructures to Prioritize AI Innovation 
↳ Why does it matter? 
This past week, news emerged that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has announced a major 
leadership restructuring, naming a new Chief Technology and AI Officer. This 
move aims to accelerate Intel’s AI strategy and strengthen its position against 
rivals like Nvidia. Making AI central to their strategy isn’t just smart—it’s about 
survival. To succeed in this tough game, companies need new organizational 
structures. For example, as the U.S. government plays a key role in supporting 
semiconductor firms (as do China, Europe and others), companies must elevate 
the government relations function, as Intel’s case suggests. 
----------------Page (163) Break----------------
↳ My thoughts on it 
This marks another chapter in Intel’s history. Once the world’s emblematic 
semiconductor company, it has struggled to keep pace with competition and the 
AI revolution. Business history is full of cases where incumbents miss 
opportunities and are disrupted—locked in the past, averse to risk and resistant to 
change. Despite knowing this pattern, it keeps repeating. That said, don’t listen to 
the “industry specialists”—demand for semiconductors will only grow, and there’s 
still room for innovation. Outsiders will probably be the ones to show how. No 
country can lead globally without mastering chip technology and building 
manufacturing capacity in the area. The U.S. understands that and backs Intel. 
China does the same with its indigenous players. Exciting times ahead.

 Biotech Becomes a National Security Frontier 
↳ Why does it matter? 
The U.S. National Commission on Emerging Biotech Security released its report 
recently, recommending a $15 billion investment over the next five years to regain 
biotech leadership, citing China’s progress in military biotechnology. National 
security has a critical economic dimension that remains poorly understood in 
most nations—not just a defense one. Biotech is expected to grow at a 9–10% 
CAGR over the next decade. Any country concerned about its future should have 
a biotech strategy. The time is now, or it will be too late to aspire to any future 
relevant position in this race. 
----------------Page (164) Break----------------
↳ My thoughts on it 
Global investments and developments in biotech are accelerating but remain 
largely overlooked by mainstream discourse and under the radar for the general 
public. The US remains the dominant player—55% of global investment in biotech 
startups is concentrated there. China is a clear contender—in just five years, the 
market cap of Chinese biopharma companies grew from $1 billion to $200 billion. 
Countries like the UAE—uniquely positioned to act on strategic vision—have been 
investing in biotechnology with intent. There are clear signs that very soon 
biology and biotechnology will define  geopolitics just as much as silicon. This 
also makes me think about lost opportunities and a certain big, fun tropical 
country south of the Equator that I know well—competitiveness advantage is 
built, not a given.

 Xi Doubles Down on Regional Influence  
↳ Why does it matter? 
Amid rising trade tensions with the U.S., Chinese President Xi Jinping toured 
Southeast Asia this past week to reinforce ties with neighbors like Vietnam and 
Malaysia. The push aims to secure regional partnerships as China braces for 
deeper economic fragmentation. The world was never flat, and the importance of 
regional markets has now been elevated. But there are markets and markets... for 
instance, Southeast Asia is bigger and more dynamic than Latin America. 
Securing a position there is key in today’s geopolitical competition. 
----------------Page (165) Break----------------
↳ My thoughts on it 
When global order fractures, regional alliances gain importance. For emerging 
countries, having to choose between the US or China is the worst-case 
scenario—it’s like having two clients and suddenly hearing from one that they’ll 
only keep doing business with you if you stop serving the other. There’s no good 
solution: either way, you lose an important part of your business and revenue. 
Like never before in recent decades, emerging nations must, in the short term, 
build the capabilities to navigate a complex global geopolitical landscape. This is 
urgent. In the mid term, we can expect new alliances to form among these 
countries to bypass the main powers and build resilience. It’s about pooling the 
risk.

 The Dire Wolf Comeback: Species are blurring 
↳ Why does it matter? 
US biotech firm  Colossal Biosciences has announced the return of the dire wolf, a 
species that went extinct over 10,000 years ago. Using DNA from ancient remains 
and modern wolves as genetic scaffolds, the company has created a living, breathing 
hybrid that closely resembles the iconic predator. These new beings share 99.5% of 
their DNA with grey wolves. This breakthrough pushes the boundaries of 
de-extinction science and signals that we will increasingly see hybrid beings come to 
life. The potential for synthetic biology is tremendous, as are the ethical and 
ecological questions it raises. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
We’re entering a Jurassic Park reality — minus the T. rex (for now). Species 
conservation, ecosystem engineering and the rise of synbio are all connected in this 
story. And let’s be clear: we’re just at the beginning of the synbio evolution — expect 
a lot to happen over the next 20 years. As synbio grows and becomes more 
accessible, we’ll see a blurring of species. How different are species, genetically?

 Lagarde’s Swipe at Visa & Mastercard 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, has called on the EU to 
develop its own independent payments platform to reduce reliance on American 
giants like Visa and Mastercard and China’s AliPay. Her remarks highlight growing 
concerns over digital sovereignty, especially as global finance becomes more 
politicized and countries seek to secure critical capabilities. This also ties into 
broader conversations around a digital euro and Europe’s role in shaping the future 
of financial infrastructure. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
This is bigger than payments — it's about controlling critical infrastructure and 
developing indigenous tech and business capabilities. In today’s world, that matters 
a lot. The EU doesn’t just want to regulate American and Chinese big tech in 
European markets anymore — it wants to replace it with sovereign European 
alternatives. The task is massive, but if they succeed, we could witness a major 
global shift with ripple effects across many sectors. In Brazil, a country of 215 
million people, 90% are online and 99% of them use WhatsApp. Of those, 80% prefer

 Washington’s AI Order: Bureaucracy, Meet 
Algorithms 
↳ Why does it matter? 
On April 7, 2025, the White House issued a sweeping directive requiring all federal 
agencies to appoint Chief AI Officers  and develop detailed strategies to scale the use 
of artificial intelligence. It’s a fundamental move aimed at cutting red tape, boosting 
efficiency and modernizing public service delivery through AI. The potential gains are 
enormous, and we can expect other governments to follow the U.S. lead — 
"dogezation" is coming to a public office  near you. This is also part of a push to 
ensure the U.S. leads in AI development and deployment, applying it to real-world 
challenges in healthcare, infrastructure and cybersecurity. Government demand and 
resources can play a major role in accelerating AI adoption. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
This marks a shift from experimenting with AI to embedding it in the machinery of 
government. While it’s a milestone for innovation and public sector efficiency, the 
real challenge now is deployment — and the questions are many. Who audits these 
algorithms? What happens when opaque models make decisions with real human 
consequences? What if things go wrong? The U.S. is placing a bet: that AI can make 
the state smarter — but it must also make it more accountable. The stakes are high.

 Europe’s Space Awakening 
↳ Why does it matter? 
After years of trailing the US and China, Europe finally seems to be taking 
commercial space and space tech entrepreneurship seriously. Last week, Isar 
Aerospace launched a rocket from Norway—the flight lasted only 40 seconds, but the 
company gathered valuable data. With other private startups like Rocket Factory 
Augsburg (Germany) and Latitude (France) preparing for launches, Europe is pushing 
----------------Page (170) Break----------------
for independent orbital access. The EU is backing these moves with funding and 
regulatory reform, aiming to compete in the space economy, not just space science. 
It makes sense—this is a market projected to hit $1 trillion by 2040 (Morgan Stanley) 
or $1.8 trillion by 2035 (McKinsey). 
↳ My thoughts on it 
There are hopes this could be Europe’s SpaceX moment — but in plural. Rather than 
backing a single champion, Europe is fostering an ecosystem of small, focused 
rocket startups. It marks a long-overdue shift from “public prestige” programs like 
Ariane to a commercial mindset focused on speed, flexibility and iteration. If 
successful, this won’t just be about catching up — it could offer a new model for 
sovereign access to space in the private launch era. The big question: does Europe 
have the entrepreneurial drive and ability to mobilize massive resources like the US

— and as OpenAI itself was hacked in late 2023. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
This could be a pivotal moment. OpenAI entering the cybersecurity arena signals a 
shift from reactive to predictive defense. Just as AI can generate fake emails or 
mimic voices, it can also act as a guardian — detecting anomalies in real time and 
adapting to new attack patterns. We’ll likely see a new wave of AI-native security 
platforms built not just to resist AI-powered threats but to learn from them faster 
than humans ever could. Expect more AI-driven cybersecurity tools and “coaches” to 
emerge, filling gaps people can’t cover. The real question is: how effective will they 
be in shaping human behavior — the weakest link in any security chain?

 Brains matter 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Knowledge is a strategic asset. As global competition intensifies—especially  
between the U.S. and China—science, research, and innovation capabilities are 
becoming central to national power. Recent shifts in U.S. science funding, 
immigration policy, and university priorities are creating ripple effects worldwide. As 
the U.S. tightens access for some international researchers, and China boosts its 
own research ecosystem, other regions are stepping in and many news about 
‘attracting talent’ have emerged. The European Union and even Brazil are launching 
----------------Page (172) Break----------------
initiatives to attract global talent. This matters not just for the U.S.—it matters for the 
world. These shifts may open new opportunities for countries that are prepared to 
seize them. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The U.S. has long led in science, tech and innovation, partly due to its ability to 
attract brilliant minds from around the world. In places like the Bay Area, over 35% of 
residents and 70% of engineers were born abroad. That openness, dynamism and 
concentration of talent and capital has been a core competitive edge. But with shifts 
underway, the global balance of talent may change. Who’s ready to step in? Are 
countries equipped to attract and retain top global talent? Do they have the right 
toolkits—policy frameworks, research funding, leadership and innovation 
ecosystems? Europe hopes to reverse the brain drain and draw back talent it once 
lost. China is acting. Any surprises? It’s too early to call the long-term outcomes—but 
not too early for governments and institutions to ask tough questions and act.

 The brain has immense potential — remember that 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Published last week, new research using fMRI scans on awake infants reveals that 
the hippocampus—the brain's memory hub—is already active in encoding episodic 
memories by around one year of age. This challenges the long-held assumption that 
infantile amnesia stems from immature brain structures incapable of storing 
information. Instead, the findings suggest the core issue may lie in how memories 
are retrieved later in life, not in how they’re initially formed. We still know so little 
about our brains, and this opens new directions for understanding long-term memory 
consolidation and, hopefully, developing treatments to combat memory loss. As 
populations age, this will become an increasingly important frontier. 
----------------Page (174) Break----------------
↳ My thoughts on it 
If the brain encodes more than it lets us recall, memory isn’t just about storage 
capacity and integrity, but also about the paths we never learn to follow back. Can we 
learn to access those paths and unlock new potential? Can we train ourselves to 
develop new human capabilities? What technologies and protocols could enable 
that? As we uncover more about our extraordinary brains, new frontiers may emerge. 
With new discoveries, aging populations and rising mental health challenges, it’s no 
surprise the neurotechnology market is projected to reach USD 28.57 billion by 2029, 
growing at a CAGR of 13.5% since 2024. It’s something worth remembering.

 We are diving in uncharted waters 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Last Thursday, a Canadian company announced it has begun negotiations with the 
Trump administration to mine the seabed. The environmental impact could be 
massive, and environmental organizations have already protested. After more than a 
decade of work, the International Seabed Authority (ISA)—a treaty-based body with 
167 member countries (the US is not one of them)—has failed to establish global 
regulations for seabed resource exploration. In the same week, China unveiled a 
powerful new deep-sea cable cutter capable of operating at depths of up to 4,000 
meters. Developed by the China Ship Scientific   Research Centre (CSSRC), the device 
is small enough to be mounted on submersibles like the Fendouzhe. While officially 
described as a tool for civilian uses such as seabed mining or rescue missions, this 
is a textbook example of a dual-use technology. Its ability to sever undersea 
communication and power cables—critical to the global internet and energy 
----------------Page (175) Break----------------
infrastructure—raises major security concerns. The deep sea has become a hot new 
frontier, and we have no rules. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The deep sea is a strategic frontier and one of the few environments on Earth that 
humans have not yet profoundly transformed, disrupted or degraded. Now, it’s 
becoming the stage for a modern-day Wild West rush. On the surface, we quietly 
witness the failure of our global governance system—though candidates for sheriff 
are not in short supply. Turbulent waters lie ahead. The most complex moment in our 
short history on this planet brings unprecedented challenges, yet we lack the 
systems, protocols and structures needed to confront them. Will human civilization 
stay afloat?

 Australia heads to the polls on May 3 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has officially called a federal election 
for May 3, launching a five-week campaign where the cost of living is expected to 
dominate. Albanese is seeking a second term for his center-left Labor government, 
while opposition leader Peter Dutton positions his conservative coalition as better 
suited to manage economic pressures. Across the globe, political systems are 
showing signs of strain, and Australia could see its first one-term government since 
1931. Everywhere, governments are under pressure to deliver—an increasingly 
----------------Page (176) Break----------------
difficult  task in our fast-changing digital world. The systems in place seem 
ill-equipped for the challenges of the 21st century. We live in times of turbulence. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Liberal democracies are under pressure globally. Australia’s election will be one to 
watch—not just for its domestic economic debate, but for what it may reveal about 
the functioning and stability of political systems worldwide and the ripple effects on 
climate policy, global security and diplomacy. Also worth noting: as voters grow 
more restless with traditional parties, the performance of independents and smaller 
groups could signal deeper political shifts ahead. Politicians everywhere should pay 
attention. From Paris to Beijing, from Washington to Wellington, many will be 
watching.

 eVTOLs get closer to taking off 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Announced this past week, Joby Aviation’s partnership with Virgin Atlantic marks 
a key step toward bringing electric air taxis (eVTOLs) to the UK, starting from 
major hubs like Heathrow and Manchester. While timelines remain fluid, the 
partnership signals growing confidence  in the viability of air taxi services, 
particularly when integrated with established airlines and infrastructure. This 
case highlights how challenging and time-consuming it can be to bring a new 
deep-tech hardware innovation to market—Joby was founded more than 15 years 
ago. It also underscores the critical role of partnerships with established players 
in making such breakthroughs feasible and scalable. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
This isn’t just about flying cars—it’s first about long-term investments and then 
about the future of urban mobility. The fact that airlines like Virgin and Delta are 
coming onboard signals that eVTOLs are moving from futuristic novelty to real 
commercial applications. Still, full-scale deployment might take longer than 
expected. The main technical challenge isn’t building the vehicles but air-traffic  
control and developing a system that can operate safely and at scale in urban 
settings. Will passengers trade a familiar Uber ride to the airport for a 15-minute 
airborne commute? That remains to be seen. More importantly, executing this 
----------------Page (178) Break----------------
requires massive investment. Joby, a VC and CVC-backed company, has raised 
over $2 billion to make this vision a reality. In which countries can a company like 
this secure such funding? Think about it. I have clear ideas about where—and 
where not—this is possible and would be happy to discuss further.

 The humanoid robot race 
↳ Why does it matter? 
The competition to bring humanoid robots to mass production is no longer just a 
distant possibility. With Figure AI unveiling a production line capable of building 
12,000 units a year and Chinese players like Midea and Unitree entering the game 
(with a kung fu bot doing side flips), we’re witnessing a shift from sci-fi  to 
industrial reality. Analysts are now treating humanoid robots as a potential new 
economic sector, one that could rival the automotive industry in scope. The 
implications for labor, manufacturing, and global tech dominance are massive. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
This isn’t just a tech flex—it’s a geopolitical tech race where advanced economies 
are building an edge and further distancing themselves from the rest of the pack. 
The fact that both the US and China are announcing humanoid milestones in the 
same week speaks volumes. The speed at which we’re moving from concept to 
capability is stunning. The real question is no longer if humanoids will be 
integrated into society, but how fast and with what societal implications—and just 
----------------Page (179) Break----------------
as importantly, who will dominate the market, make (a lot of) money and build a 
lasting competitive position. Whether humanoid robots end up assisting in 
factories or patrolling cities, their societal impact is coming—and fast. Things will 
change.

 DeepMind’s robots play soccer 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Google DeepMind has trained miniature humanoid robots to play one-on-one 
soccer, mastering complex skills like walking, kicking, and recovering from falls. 
More impressively, the robots began to show game intelligence—anticipating the 
ball’s movement and blocking shots—quite impressive for me, a guy known as the 
worst soccer player ever born in Brazil. While it may look playful on the surface, 
this is a serious demonstration of how reinforcement learning and robotics are 
converging to enable adaptive, real-time decision-making in physical 
environments. It’s a glimpse into the future of autonomous agents operating in 
dynamic, unpredictable settings. Above all, this move highlights a growing 
convergence between AI and robotics—not just in technology, but among the 
companies driving these fields. Have you seen NVIDIA’s announcement this past 
week? 
↳ My thoughts on it 
This is a step toward the goal of RoboCup (link below), as I mentioned here a few 
weeks ago, but the implications go far beyond the pitch. Teaching humanoid 
robots to coordinate movement and make split-second decisions is a massive 
----------------Page (180) Break----------------
breakthrough for robotics in complex real-world situations. If they can learn 
soccer, why not warehouse logistics, manufacturing, emergency response, 
warfighting  (I bet this will scale first), or even elderly care? What starts as a game 
may end up training the next generation of machines that move and think like 
us—and maybe even better. Back in 2013, I wrote a piece for Startupi, a Brazilian 
startup web portal, about “Google Resources”—now, Google and other big tech 
firms are bringing their resources to the robot game, and this will accelerate 
things. Fasten your seatbelts.

 China’s new silicon-free chip: A breakthrough in 
semiconductor technology? 
↳ Why does it matter? 
A research team at Peking University claims to have developed a bismuth-based 
computer chip that is 40% faster and 10% more energy-efficient  than the latest 3nm 
silicon chips from Intel and TSMC. This silicon-free approach could allow China to 
bypass restrictions imposed by U.S. sanctions and revolutionize chip design by 
eliminating some of the fundamental limitations of silicon-based semiconductors. 
With global demand for faster, more efficient chips skyrocketing, this development 
has the potential to reshape the semiconductor race and challenge the dominance of 
traditional chipmakers. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
As many analysts predict the end of Moore's Law, the race for new materials, design 
concepts, architectures, and fabrication methods for computer chips is wide open. If 
the Peking University team delivers on its promise, we could be witnessing a 
paradigm shift in semiconductors. The fact that China is leading this potential 
breakthrough adds another layer to the geopolitical chip war. But will this technology 
scale to commercial viability? And if silicon is no longer the future, which tech giants 
will adapt fastest—and who will be left behind? To close, we should not forget that

 Greenland’s election shifts independence debate as 
Trump eyes control 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Greenland’s Demokraatit party secured victory in Tuesday’s election, advocating for a 
gradual approach to independence from Denmark. This comes amid a turbulent 
geopolitical landscape, as President Trump has openly expressed interest in bringing 
Greenland under U.S. control. With Russia and China expanding their Arctic military 
presence, Greenland’s position—along with its vast critical mineral reserves—is 
becoming a focal point in global power struggles. While most Greenlanders support 
eventual independence, many fear the economic risks of breaking away too 
quickly—or falling under U.S. influence. This election may have added more 
uncertainty to an already complex equation. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The issue with Greenland is that its situation has unexpectedly taken center stage, 
surprising many of us. Things we once took for granted in the world are now being 
questioned. This seems to be the new normal, and there is no playbook for 
navigating today’s global landscape.Geography matters—a lot. Is Greenland prepared

 New insights into DNA repair: Could NEMO  be the 
key to overcoming chemoresistance? 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Every minute, 20 people die from cancer worldwide. The suffering and costs are 
immense. Researchers have discovered that NEMO, a protein that regulates immune 
responses, inflammation, cell survival, and proliferation, plays a crucial role in 
directing DNA repair machinery to damaged sites. NEMO helps cells repair DNA 
damage caused by UV exposure and chemotherapy. This discovery has major 
implications for cancer treatment—a high presence of NEMO correlates with 
chemoresistance and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. In other words, 
NEMO repairs damaged DNA in cancer cells, but instead of restoring them to normal, 
it keeps them in a dysfunctional, cancerous state. Targeting NEMO-related pathways 
could make chemotherapy more effective in resistant tumors, save lives and lower 
costs in health systems. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
We know so little about the universe and the engines of life, but we are learning fast. 
This discovery adds another layer to our understanding of why some cancers resist 
treatment and, more importantly, hints at potential mechanisms to overcome that 
----------------Page (184) Break----------------
problem. With cancer rates rising globally, how soon can these findings translate into 
real-world therapies? The annual global economic cost of cancer represents about 
0.55% of the global GDP. The suffering? Immeasurable. This small discovery is a 
reminder of the importance of research in the field—every step matters. Moreover, it 
highlights the importance of funding research.

 The rise of biological AI: Can lab-grown neurons 
redefine   computing? 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Melbourne-based startup Cortical Labs launched CL1 this past week, the world’s first 
commercialized biological computer, containing lab-grown human neurons capable 
of learning. Unlike traditional AI models that require massive computational power, 
CL1 consumes just a few watts, mimicking the efficiency of biological brains. 
Researchers see potential applications in disease modeling, drug testing, and 
intelligence research, but the technology also raises ethical challenges. This was a 
‘first’, but we should expect similar products to reach the market soon. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
This breakthrough challenges the fundamental way we think about computation and 
AI—if artificial intelligence is meant to mimic the brain, why not use actual neurons? 
The potential is staggering, but so are the unknowns. How far can this technology go 
before we start questioning the ethics of creating biological intelligence? And if 
neurons can learn, how do we ensure they don’t develop traits we don’t fully 
understand? Are we on the brink of a revolution in computing, or opening a door we 
may not be ready to walk through? Questions abound, and this is just the beginning.

 Volkswagen bets on ultra-cheap EVs with Rivian 
tech 
----------------Page (186) Break----------------
↳ Why does it matter? 
Volkswagen is making a bold move into the ‘budget’ EV market with the ID EVERY1, a 
€20,000 ($21,500) electric hatchback set to launch in 2027 and announced this 
week. This will be the first model to integrate Rivian’s software and vehicle 
architecture, marking a major milestone in their $5.8 billion joint venture. With this 
partnership, VW aims to compete with China’s aggressive low-cost EV expansion, 
while Rivian secures a cash injection and a broader business footprint beyond its 
premium models. With software-defined  capabilities powered by Rivian, enabling 
post-purchase upgrades, VW hopes to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving EV 
landscape. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
This is a pivotal moment for both Volkswagen and Rivian. Competition from Chinese 
automakers is heating up, challenging the heart of Germany's manufacturing. 
Volkswagen plans to release the ID.2all in 2026, priced at €25,000. Both models are 
part of VW’s new Electric Urban Car Family with front-wheel drive, developed to equip 
cars across all volume brands of the Volkswagen Group. It remains to be seen if VW 
can successfully offer ultra-cheap EVs at scale while competing with Tesla, BYD, and 
other Chinese manufacturers—without compromising profitability. For Rivian, the key 
question is whether this move will help scale production or dilute its brand.

 Israel’s AI-powered surveillance: A new frontier in 
intelligence gathering 
----------------Page (187) Break----------------
↳ Why does it matter? 
Israel’s elite intelligence unit, Unit 8200, has reportedly developed a powerful AI 
model trained on intercepted Palestinian communications to enhance surveillance 
and intelligence-gathering. Described as a ChatGPT-like tool, the system processes 
vast amounts of private conversations to generate insights on monitored individuals. 
While the Israeli military claims the technology is needed for its counterterrorism 
efforts, experts warn that AI-driven intelligence tools lack transparency and could 
amplify biases, increasing the risk of serious errors. The genius is out of the bottle. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
AI is revolutionizing intelligence and everything else. When mass surveillance is 
combined with opaque, error-prone AI models, new risks emerge. What happens if a 
system misidentifies     threats? Who would be accountable for the consequences? I 
predict that as other nations develop their own AI-powered intelligence tools, this 
approach and technology will quickly become the standard. AI is often framed as a 
tool for efficiency, but in high-stakes environments like this, does efficiency have to 
come at the cost of human rights? We are just at the beginning of the AI age, and 
most of the questions we need to ask and issues we will soon face are still under the 
radar.

 Humanoid robots: Figure AI’s rapid rise signals a 
robotics revolution 
↳ Why does it matter? Humanoid robotics startup Figure AI is skyrocketing, now 
seeking a $1.5 billion funding round at a massive $39.5 billion valuation—just 
months after raising $675 million at a $2.6 billion valuation. Featured in this 
Snapshot a few months ago, the company highlights the rapid maturation of 
AI-powered robotics as a major investment frontier. Initially collaborating with 
OpenAI, Figure has now shifted to internal AI development, shedding light on the 
different strategies companies can adopt to pursue leadership in AI-powered 
businesses. In short: there isn't a single path and this is a moment when various 
strategies are being experimented. 
↳ My thoughts on it This rapid surge in humanoid robotics suggests we're nearing a 
tipping point, where robots shift from futuristic concepts to essential workplace 
solutions. But as Figure moves away from OpenAI, its bet on internal breakthroughs 
raises many questions. Does this strategy make sense, or is it too much risk-taking? 
Investors are making bold bets. Tech giants like Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla are also 
racing to commercialize humanoid robots, while Nvidia unveiled new

 Musicians fight back: Silent album protests AI 
copyright threat 
↳ Why does it matter? Over 1,000 artists, including Annie Lennox, Kate Bush, and 
Damon Albarn, have released a silent album to protest proposed UK copyright 
changes that would allow AI companies to train models using copyrighted work 
without a license. The “opt-out” system puts the burden on artists to protect their 
work—an impossible task in the vast digital landscape. The backlash comes as the 
UK government argues its current copyright rules are holding back AI development, 
sparking fears that creative industries will be sacrificed  for tech innovation. Over and 
over, tech advancement challenges institutions. 
↳ My thoughts on it This isn’t just about music—it’s about the future of creativity in 
the AI age, how we govern economic and social relations, the behaviors we want to 
instill in society, and how institutions can and should adapt. If governments make it 
easier for AI to mine copyrighted work without consent, where does that leave 
artists, writers, and creators? Is this a necessary compromise for AI progress or a 
reckless giveaway to big tech? And if artists' voices are being drowned out now, will 
the creative industries even have a say in what comes next? Facts unfolding. A lot 
more is to come.

 China’s thorium discovery: A game-changer for 
global energy? 
↳ Why does it matter? China’s latest survey suggests its thorium reserves—already 
the world’s largest—may be vastly underestimated. Thorium is a mineral that holds 
two orders of magnitude more energy than uranium. If fully utilized, just one mining 
complex in China could fuel the country for 60,000 years. Thorium-based nuclear 
reactors promise a cleaner, safer alternative to fossil fuels and traditional uranium 
reactors, potentially reshaping the global energy landscape. China has been an early 
investor in thorium-based reactors. If the reserves are confirmed   and the country 
masters thorium energy, it could achieve unprecedented energy independence while 
challenging the dominance of established fuel exporters. 
↳ My thoughts on it An “endless energy source” sounds like science fiction, but if 
thorium truly delivers, it could rewrite geopolitical power dynamics. Today, uranium 
and plutonium are the primary elements used in nuclear power. Why? Because 
nuclear energy has traditionally been tied to military R&D, and both elements are 
used to make atomic bombs. Thorium, on the other hand, is not fissile and cannot be 
used to make atomic bombs, but it can serve as a fuel in nuclear reactors. A 
powerful question: with global powers racing for energy security and technology 
dominance, will thorium spark new competition—or could it help end the energy wars 
of the past century?

 US and Russia explore end to Ukraine war 
↳ Why does it matter? 
U.S. and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia this week to discuss the war in Ukraine 
and potential opportunities that could arise from ending it. The meeting signals a 
shift in Washington’s stance and highlights Saudi Arabia's growing role as a global 
player. Last but not least, it sends a clear message to Europe about the need to take 
the lead in shaping its own future. 
----------------Page (192) Break----------------
↳ My thoughts on it 
Europe faces many challenges today—an economy that has lost dynamism and seen 
stagnant growth since 2008, security concerns heightened by the war in Ukraine, 
growing discontent within populations across European nations regarding Brussels 
and the rise of populism. The world is changing fast, and reality (and realpolitik) is 
asserting itself. Will this be a wake-up call for Europe to take responsibility for its 
security and assume a leadership role in shaping its future in an increasingly 
competitive world? What global configur ation will we see in 10, 20 or even 50 years 
as a result of the events unfolding today?

 US and UK out of step with the world on AI 
↳ Why does it matter? 
The recent Paris AI Summit aimed to unite global leaders on AI governance, but the 
US and UK refused to sign a key declaration backed by 60 nations, including France, 
China and India. The reason? A firm  stance against regulations that could “strangle” 
AI development. With the US locked in an AI race with China, the Trump 
administration is pushing for minimal restrictions, and the UK is following suit, 
prioritizing AI investment over regulation. This divergence leaves Europe isolated in 
its push for safety-first  AI policies and raises questions about the feasibility of global 
AI governance and the competitiveness of European AI efforts. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
----------------Page (193) Break----------------
Europe is not as competitive in AI as the US or China. Pursuing a regulation-first    
approach while others are free to explore alternative paths usually results in a lack of 
competitiveness rather than greater safety or security. Regulating a fast-evolving 
technology is extremely challenging—how can we anticipate outcomes when so 
many unknowns exist? However, the debate over whether to regulate AI assumes 
that oversight equals regulation and follows a Western paradigm, creating false 
dilemmas. We need innovation—oversight frameworks that allow governments in 
democratic regimes to intervene swiftly and effectively when a change of course is 
needed. For that to be possible, really strong state capacity is essential. That 
remains a privilege of few.

 A quantum chip breakthrough: hype reloaded or real 
progress? 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Microsoft claims its new chip, powered by the world’s first ‘topoconductor’ (a new 
type of material, that can create a new state of matter-not a solid, liquid, gas or 
plasma), could make practical quantum computing a reality within years rather than 
decades. If true, this would be a breakthrough on par with the invention of 
semiconductors, paving the way for ultra-powerful machines that could solve 
problems beyond classical computing’s reach—such as cracking encryption, 
revolutionizing materials science, and optimizing complex systems. However, 
physicists urge caution, noting that while the development is promising, major 
hurdles remain before quantum computing scales beyond the lab. 
----------------Page (194) Break----------------
↳ My thoughts on it 
The race to build a functional large-scale quantum computer has been full of bold 
claims, but could this be the real tipping point? DARPA has bet on it. If Microsoft’s 
technology scales up and truly enables million-qubit quantum systems, the 
implications would be staggering. Yet, quantum computing has long been a hyped 
moving target, and its biggest challenge isn’t just theoretical—it’s making these 
systems stable and commercially viable. Are we on the brink of a quantum 
revolution, or is this just another step in a marathon still far from the finish line? Have 
your qubits ready to bet! 
To close—just note that this was a project initiated by a private sector corporation 
and launched about 20 years ago. Bold! Who else in the world could undertake 
something similar? Only a very few.

Let's dive in! 
 Europe needs a competitiveness shake-up 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Since 2008, GDP per capita in the Eurozone has stagnated, while the U.S. has 
experienced significant   growth. Europe faces a major competitiveness problem, 
lagging behind both the U.S. and China. It lacks the economic dynamism of these 
two global players. The war in Ukraine has further impacted the region, especially in 
terms of energy prices. European manufacturing, particularly the automotive sector, 
is struggling against Chinese competition. Meanwhile, Europe has no major tech 
companies to drive growth. The release of the European Competitiveness Compass 
last week is highly relevant in this context—Europe’s future is at stake. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The European Union has been a success in securing peace and stability, but its 
economic dynamism is fading. While Europe offers high quality of life, it is not 
growing. Unlike the U.S., it faces demographic decline and lacks a strong innovation 
ecosystem. Germany, once a manufacturing powerhouse, is now in check as Chinese 
automakers gain market share. Rising internal tensions, exacerbated by the energy 
crisis, add to the challenge. The Competitiveness Compass released on January 29 is 
a response to Mario Draghi’s earlier report. The big question: does the EU have the 
time to implement meaningful change? With growing political opposition to Brussels 
----------------Page (196) Break----------------
in key Eurozone nations, the pressure is on. Can Europe adapt before it’s too late?

 Our great-great-grandparents may have come from 
far away 
↳ Why does it matter? 
We still don’t fully understand the origins of life on Earth. A Nature paper published 
last week provides new insights. Scientists analyzing the asteroid Bennu found that 
it contains 14 of the 20 amino acids essential for life on Earth (the building blocks of 
RAN/DNA), along with a high concentration of ammonia. This discovery strengthens 
the hypothesis that extraterrestrial materials could have contributed to life’s building 
blocks on our planet. It also sheds light on the chemical conditions during the 
formation of the solar system and the origins of organic molecules. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
We know so little about the universe—and about ourselves. Dark matter and dark 
energy make up most of the universe, while what we consider "normal" matter 
accounts for only about 5%—just a fraction. Beyond its scientific   significance,  
discoveries about the universe and the origins of life raise deep philosophical and 
existential questions about our connection to the cosmos. Practically, understanding 
the chemistry of asteroids like Bennu could help prioritize future space research and 
exploration. It may also accelerate interest in astrobiology—a field that is gaining 
----------------Page (197) Break----------------
importance. I personally know only a few astrobiologists, but not many. Do you know 
anyone working in this space? It’s a field worth watching.

 The quest to democratize AI 
↳ Why does it matter? 
The release of DeepSeek’s R1, an open-source LLM from China, dominated 
discussions across business, tech, policy, and defense this past week. But its 
implications extend far beyond the US-China competition, the tech world and stock 
markets. The fact that this model was trained at a fraction of the cost previously 
considered standard signals a major shift. It suggests that AI development may not 
remain exclusive to tech giants with massive resources. This week, India announced 
further investments in AI infrastructure and a national model to compete with 
OpenAI and DeepSeek, reinforcing the trend of broader AI accessibility. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
AI holds immense potential across sectors—from business to education, where AI 
tutors in Africa are already improving student performance and learning. However, if 
frontier AI models require hundreds of billions to build, only a handful of 
countries—until a week or so ago, only two, right?—and companies can lead, even if 
many can be users. The emergence of lower-cost, high-performance LLMs is 
changing that. We are witnessing the democratization of both access to AI and the 
ability to develop AI models. The fact that advanced reasoning models can now be 
built more efficiently means more governments and companies can become 
creators, not just users, of AI. People have recognized these new possibilities, and I 
bet more models like DeepSeek will emerge. I also expect more nations to invest in 
----------------Page (198) Break----------------
their own AI initiatives to reduce reliance on foreign-controlled technologies. The 
genie is out of the bottle.

 Welcome your new co-worker and partner 
↳ Why does it matter? 
----------------Page (199) Break----------------
OpenAI’s announcement of Operator offers a glimpse of what’s just around the 
corner. Soon, we will be able to ask computers to perform tasks we currently 
delegate to coworkers, assistants, team members or interns. This marks a 
significant   step in how AI will integrate into daily workflows   and transform the way 
we work and live. It also demonstrates that AI is ready to operate in “our world,” a 
world designed for humans, with interfaces that humans understand and use. Soon, 
machines will no longer be confined  to the world of ones and zeros. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Operator showcases the true potential of AI as a transformational technology. It’s 
not just about speeding up processes—it’s about fundamentally changing how we 
interact with machines and viewing them as “peers.” By offloading  tasks we once 
assigned to people, AI is redefining  collaboration, productivity, and efficiency. This is 
more than a glimpse of the future—it’s a clear signal that change is coming fast. The 
implications for workplaces, personal productivity, and even societal structures are 
enormous. We all need to prepare for this shift and, honestly, I can’t wait to have 
Operator as a partner.

 Guerrillas in 2025: Colombia is trapped in the past 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Colombia’s decades-long struggle with guerrilla groups seemed to be fading, 
especially after President Petro, a former guerrilla leader who dropped arms and 
joined the political system, came to power. However, the recent acknowledgment 
that negotiations with the ELN have failed marks a turning point, with the country 
now shifting its approach toward the group. This highlights that guerrilla activity 
remains a challenge for Colombia in 2025—a conflict  that feels outdated in today’s 
----------------Page (200) Break----------------
world. The country will need to allocate additional resources to combat this, diverting 
funds from other critical priorities. Furthermore, it underscores the significant   
internal challenges faced by South American countries at a time of global 
transformation and rising geopolitical tensions. Balancing these internal and external 
pressures is an immense challenge. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
It’s surprising, disappointing, and astonishing to see this still happening in 2025. 
Developments in Colombia reveal the difficulty of addressing deep-rooted conflicts  in 
the complex context of ‘emerging’ countries. Guerrilla movements in South America 
are a stark reminder of the failure of political systems to deliver the scale of societal 
transformation required—not just in Colombia, but across Latin America and beyond. 
Globally, political systems are falling short in meeting citizens' needs. It’s 
disheartening to see a country of immense beauty and potential still burdened by 
outdated conflicts  and movements clinging to antiquated ideologies. This represents 
a tragic waste of resources and potential for a nation that deserves to move forward.

 China: Knowledge and scale matter 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Global competition is increasingly about dominating critical technologies. Countries 
that excel at creating knowledge and translating it into market-ready products and 
solutions at speed and scale will lead this race. The latest Nature index reveals a 
significant   shift: among the top 10 universities globally for research output, Harvard 
ranks first, but the remaining nine are Chinese. This underscores China’s rise as a 
----------------Page (201) Break----------------
scientific   powerhouse and highlights the growing importance of science and 
innovation in global competition. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Science is essential, but success also depends on turning knowledge into 
market-ready innovations. Both the U.S. and China are uniquely positioned to lead 
due to their scale, resources, and R&D investments—$900 billion in the U.S. and $500 
billion in China in 2024. Scale also extends to talent. China and India produce far 
more STEM graduates than the U.S., and fewer Chinese students are now studying in 
America. The competition between China’s state-driven approach and the U.S.’s 
market-driven model will shape the future. Ultimately, it comes down to systems and 
scale. Scale matters, and in this race, it could be the decisive factor. Finally, among 
the top 50 universities in Nature’s ranking, only one is in continental Europe: ETH 
Zurich. Revealing, isn’t it?

 Rare Earths: Are We Paying Attention? 
----------------Page (202) Break----------------
↳ Why does it matter? 
The world relies heavily on rare earth materials, with demand growing at a compound 
annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9–13%. These materials are essential for batteries, 
EVs, semiconductors, electronics, and even quantum technologies. Recent 
announcements from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and news from the US and 
Africa highlight two critical trends: the search for new supply sources and the 
potential for technological breakthroughs to significantly  impact the industry. While 
rare earth materials are not truly rare, extracting them from low concentrations is 
resource-intensive—those who can lower costs may gain a competitive edge. China's 
new technology, which recovers 95% of materials in much shorter cycles while using 
60% less energy, further strengthens its dominant position. At the same time, 
investments in Africa by figures like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos underscore the 
importance of untapped reserves and the continent’s growing global significance.  
↳ My thoughts on it 
We live in a fast-changing world, and Africa is becoming central to the global 
conversation—not just because of migration, population growth, and climate change, 
but also as a major source of natural resources. However, old models of engagement 
are unlikely to work. This is not what African countries seek, and projects that simply 
extract minerals from Africa are unlikely to be sustainable—politically, economically, 
socially, or environmentally. Meanwhile, China’s advancements in rare earth 
processing could further entrench its market dominance and serve as a powerful 
reminder that competitive advantage is not granted by nature but built by humans. 
These two trends—new resource exploration in Africa (and other parts of the world) 
and technological innovation in mineral discovery, mining, and processing—will 
significantly  shape the future of rare earths and the global economy. We should 
closely monitor how they evolve.

 How $450 is Changing the AI Game 
↳ Why does it matter? 
AI is everywhere, and its influence is expanding rapidly. However, building AI models 
is highly resource-intensive, requiring millions of GPUs, massive data centers, huge 
datasets, and significant   energy. That’s why the University of Berkeley's 
announcement of training a reasoning model for less than $450 is astonishing—not 
to mention that it is a truly "open model," with both the data used to create it and the 
algorithm to train the network disclosed. This milestone highlights how quickly AI 
costs are dropping. Just days before this announcement, NVIDIA unveiled various 
new products and technologies at CES 2025, including the scaling up of synthetic 
data use, further driving down costs and democratizing AI capabilities. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
It all comes down to costs. For technologies to scale, they must meet a minimally 
required performance level and become affordable to segments of society and the 
economy, from which they can expand to other sectors. In the AI world (our world...), 
two trends are converging: massive investments in AI infrastructure and large-scale 
projects, and rapidly declining costs to develop high-performing models—driven by 
hardware advancements, software optimization, and new conceptual models and 
architectures. Together, these trends are propelling AI to unprecedented levels of 
performance and adoption. Some believe AGI could emerge as soon as 2025 or 
2026, while AI is becoming increasingly embedded in everything and everyday life. 
Advances at the cutting edge and broad dissemination are accelerating 
simultaneously. Even with this awareness, we are likely to be surprised by what 
comes next.

 Longevity: Science Fiction or Our Next Reality? 
↳ Why does it matter? 
This week’s announcement from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where 
researchers extended the lifespan of mice using an RNA strand derived from human 
cells, marks a promising development among many others occurring globally. 
Longevity is emerging as a major frontier for research and investment, even if the 
public is not fully aware. With a still young but aging an increasingly obese 
population, Saudi Arabia has become one of the main funders of research in the 
field. Initiatives like the $100 million XPRIZE Healthspan highlight and can accelerate 
global efforts in this field. However, living longer is not enough if it doesn’t come with 
quality of life. While lifespans have doubled over the last 100 years, many people 
spend their later years battling illnesses. This creates significant   societal and 
economic burdens—think of skyrocketing healthcare costs—while limiting society’s 
creative potential, as ill individuals cannot lead productive lives. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
As we age, our cells lose the ability to regenerate and begin producing more toxins, 
leading to inflammation  and reduced disease resistance. Restoring cellular 
regeneration is essential to achieving longevity. However, much more is still needed, 
including advancements in policy and social sciences. Some researchers believe 
that within the next 20–30 years, humanity may reach a point where we can add one 
year of life expectancy every year. The economic, social, and moral implications of 
such progress would be immense. While this might sound like science fiction, these 
breakthroughs are becoming increasingly visible—signaling a potential turning point. 
In the meantime, focus on what you can control: exercise, exercise, exercise, eat well, 
learn new things, nurture friendships and live a fulfilling life.

 Security has come to the central stage 
↳ Why does it matter? 
National security considerations are increasingly constraining business decisions 
worldwide, as exemplified   by President Biden’s recent executive order blocking 
Nippon Steel’s acquisition of U.S. Steel. While this trend is most evident in the 
US-China geopolitical rivalry, other countries have also recognized the importance of 
incorporating national interests into business and trade, even if they lack the tools or 
strategic clarity to do so. This shift means government actions will increasingly 
constrain companies' strategies across borders. Businesses must navigate a more 
----------------Page (206) Break----------------
complex geopolitical landscape and develop structures and capabilities to adapt to 
this new reality. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Balancing national security and foreign policy is both an art and a science, requiring 
a delicate balance. The US Steel case underscores the complexity of this challenge, 
as the US government's decision sent mixed signals to Japan, a close ally—while the 
sound of toasts in Beijing could almost be heard. As nations assert their interests in 
an interconnected world, only a few have the capabilities to manage this complexity 
effectively. Businesses and governments alike must quickly learn to operate in this 
evolving environment. Let’s watch how the case unfolds, particularly with new 
leadership in the US and beyond.

 Turbulence is in the air 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Recent events, such as Canada’s Prime Minister announcing his resignation, 
President-elect Trump’s statements about "assets" (namely Canada, Greenland, and 
Panama) important to the US—whether you like him or not, he is a master 
communicator attuned to the spirit of our times—and Meta’s major policy shift, are 
interconnected and illustrate the current dynamics of the world. The world is 
becoming increasingly complex and turbulent. Citizens are demanding that political 
systems deliver and many feel left behind. Social media acts as an amplifier   for 
which institutions are unprepared. Turbulence and shifts in political systems and 
----------------Page (207) Break----------------
global institutions create new risks for companies, societies, and governments while 
offering opportunities for challengers to the establishment. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Our institutions were built for a slower, analog world. Today’s fast-moving, digitally 
dominated landscape is far more complex, fueling anxiety and fostering division. 
Social media connects people globally but also creates isolated bubbles where 
reality holds less sway. This dynamic can destabilize political systems, particularly in 
Western democracies, which are especially vulnerable to manipulation by internal 
and external actors. Shutting down discourse is unlikely to provide a solution and 
regulation must adapt—yet no country has succeeded in doing so effectively. This is 
one of the defining  challenges of our time, requiring urgent attention and innovative 
solutions.

↳ Why does it matter? 
AI is everywhere and increasingly integrated into the physical world. This week, 
NVIDIA CEO Jensen Wong highlighted the rise of physical AI at CES 2025 in Las 
Vegas. The event showcased a myriad of robots, autonomous vehicles, and 
countless AI-powered devices. Importantly, AI is being used to generate effective 
synthetic data to train other AI systems needed in the physical world, reducing costs 
----------------Page (208) Break----------------
and accelerating innovation. Multiple feedback loops are further driving and 
accelerating this system. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Technology is advancing exponentially and, as I mentioned in my start-of-year post 
on LinkedIn, the convergence of atoms and bytes is undeniable. AI is reshaping the 
software landscape, disrupting software businesses, and gaining attention for its 
integration into the physical world—robotics, devices, sensors, and systems that 
sense and interact with the physical world. CES 2025 showcased this shift clearly. 
For those who couldn’t attend, like me, I’ve shared a collection of videos capturing

Weekly Snapshot - December 23, 2024 
 
This edition of our Weekly Snapshot is a little different, and for good reason. Lately, 
the air is buzzing with reports and insight papers peeking into 2025 and what the 
future may hold. As the year winds down and our gaze shifts toward what’s next, I’ve 
handpicked three standout reports and collections of insights to share with you. 
These aren’t just trends, they’re thought-provoking glimpses into the possibilities of 
tomorrow.

Why does it matter? 
We are living in a time of rapid technological convergence and acceleration. 
Technology, business, policy and global issues are becoming increasingly 
intertwined, creating unprecedented challenges and opportunities. 
Companies, organizations of all types and nations need to think about the future to 
avoid blind spots and identify ways to benefit  from emerging trends. More 
importantly, the act of thinking matters. Reflecting  on the future allows us to 
----------------Page (210) Break----------------
challenge assumptions about business models, societal structures, policy priorities 
and more. 
The materials I am sharing here were created using different methods and 
processes. While not exhaustive, they provide interesting clues. Understanding 
what's missing in these reports but that you are observing can also be a path to 
building competitive advantage, you may be seeking insights that others are not. 
My thoughts on it 
There’s no crystal ball for the future. Making sense of what comes next requires 
processing conflicting, asymmetric signals and drawing insights from them. This 
capability is becoming essential in business and government, yet many nations and 
organizations lack the capacity to process today’s complexities, think about the 
future, and strategize in a structured way. 
For me, the big question isn’t just understanding the future but building it. 
Future-building has always been my passion, leveraging trends, shaping 
opportunities, and creating the world we want. This is the work that should matter 
most.

 Vietnam's bet on AI & Tech 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Vietnam is one of the fastest-growing economies globally. Last week, the VinFuture 
award, a $3 million prize established by VinGroup, highlighted the country’s focus on 
technology and brought some of the world’s AI luminaries to Hanoi. NVIDIA's founder 
and CEO, Jensen Huang, Nobel Laureate Geoffrey Hinton, and Meta’s Chief AI 
Scientist Yann LeCun were among the awardees. The event showcased Vietnam's 
increasing emphasis on technology and innovation while shedding light on the 
emergence of VinGroup, a powerhouse business largely unknown in the West. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
VinGroup's story is remarkable. Founded in 1993 in Ukraine by a Vietnamese 
entrepreneur producing instant noodles, the group began operations in Vietnam in 
2000. Today, it operates across sectors such as EVs, AI, pharmaceuticals, real estate, 
fintech, healthcare, and various digital technology businesses. In some ways, it 
mirrors the rise of South Korean chaebols like Samsung. VinGroup’s founder became 
the first Vietnamese billionaire. The US-China competition has also benefited  
Vietnam in recent years, with American companies investing heavily—Apple alone 
invested at least $15 billion over five years. Vietnam's ambitions in technology are 
evident, as the country plans to train 50,000 semiconductor engineers by 2030. 
Vietnam's growth and innovation trajectory deserve more attention.

 From China to Europe: Rail Reshapes Trade 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Geography and logistics matter. Trans-Eurasia Logistics, a joint venture of Chinese, 
Russian, and German rail operators, now connects China to Europe by train, with a 
20-fold increase in train trips from 2015 to 2023. Sending a container by rail from 
China to Germany or Poland now costs half as much as by sea. Global conflicts  are 
reshaping logistics—for instance, shipping between China and Europe via the Suez 
Canal has declined by 67 percent. The New Silk Road rail line not only transforms 
global trade routes but also significantly  impacts the economies of Central Asia, 
through which it passes. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Central Asia is undergoing rapid change. During a recent call with a colleague there, 
the head of a major global consultancy reported tripling its business and team in 
Uzbekistan in less than six months. The conflict  in Ukraine has redirected 
investments to Central Asia, while the conflict  in the Middle East has increased the 
costs and risks of sea transportation in the Red Sea, benefiting  the New Silk Road. 
Together, these factors are accelerating growth and transformation in the region. 
This is also part of a larger shift in global trade dynamics. China now accounts for 
15% of Europe’s foreign trade, closing in on the U.S.'s 17%. These developments 
should be closely followed by those looking for new global business opportunities.

 Graphene Chips: The Future Beyond Moore's Law 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Our world depends on computation and semiconductors. However, we are now 
reaching the physical limits of current semiconductor technology, making it 
increasingly difficult  to keep up with Moore's Law—the idea, coined by Intel 
co-founder Gordon Moore, that the performance of computer chips doubles every 18 
months. With 3 nanometers as the node size in chips, we are approaching the 
physical theoretical minimum. A recently announced development from 
California-based Destination 2D could open a new frontier by solving key challenges 
in manufacturing chips with graphene. This breakthrough could extend Moore's Law 
and revolutionize electronics. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
As Ray Kurzweil has demonstrated, Moore's Law has held since the early 20th 
century, even before it was stated by Gordon Moore. However, the limits of 
semiconductor physics are clear. While quantum computing holds promise, it is not 
ready yet. Graphene, discovered decades ago and awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize, 
might finally be ready for practical applications. As with all new technologies, early 
performance often falls short, but this could be the turning point. Destination 2D’s 
new technology, using pressure deposition methods, could unlock graphene's 
potential for microelectronics. Has the time come for graphene chips? Make your 
bets.

 An iron breakthrough 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Steel is fundamental to our lives and all the things we manufacture—if not made of 
steel, made with steel. Recent developments in China regarding a new, rapid process 
for producing iron (and thus steel) hold significant   promise and could further 
consolidate China's leadership; today, the country produces 54% of the world's crude 
steel. Steelmaking and ironmaking are major carbon emitters. The new flash 
smelting technology can be transformational, as it does not use coal and can be 
used to decarbonize the industry. The process also performs with low-grade iron 
ores, and its future adoption could allow for the substitution of iron ore from Brazil 
and Australia with minerals mined in China. 
----------------Page (215) Break----------------
↳ My thoughts on it 
China's dominance in steel production is staggering, producing seven times more 
than the second-largest producer, India. To be fair, the country's industrial prowess in 
iron and steelmaking dates back centuries, reaching in the 11th century a volume of 
production that Europe would only achieve in the 18th century. It's remarkable to see 
a centuries-old technology being reimagined. While scaling this new process 
economically may take time, it represents a significant   step for decarbonization and 
China's competitive edge. This development is worth following closely, as it could 
impact every manufacturing sector globally.

 Quantum is getting physical 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Quantum computing is a major frontier, promising to process information far faster 
than today's computers. However, two key challenges remain: eliminating errors and 
achieving scalability. Quantum computers are sensitive, often producing errors, and 
current models operate with only a few qubits. A recent development from 
Switzerland is groundbreaking because it introduces physical qubits not based on 
electrons, realizing a concept that has been around for decades. This advancement 
can open new frontiers in computation. 
----------------Page (216) Break----------------
↳ My thoughts on it 
Computing power has followed Moore's law since the early 20th century, even before 
semiconductors. As we near the physical limits of microchips, quantum computing 
offers incredible potential. Like other transformative technologies, quantum is in its 
early stages and the "deception phase." Progress will require testing various 
solutions and architectures to create scalable, functional quantum computers. This 
new approach demonstrates the potential to innovate beyond traditional 
electron-based computing. It's a clear reminder that quantum isn't just about 
improvement—it's about reimagining computing altogether.

 Pipelines matter 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Meta's plan to build a 40,000 km subsea fiber-optic cable underscores the critical 
role of infrastructure in the digital and AI era. Control over physical assets like data 
centers and the cables connecting them is increasingly important. Data centers are 
the fastest-growing energy consumption category globally. Companies like Meta, 
Microsoft, and Google are not just creating algorithms but also building and 
powering their own infrastructure to ensure better service and reduce risks, including 
dependence on telecommunications companies. 
----------------Page (217) Break----------------
↳ My thoughts on it 
By 2030, U.S. data centers are projected to consume 8–10% of all electricity, up from 
3.5% in 2023. Globally, data center energy consumption is expected to grow by nearly 
20% annually through 2028. Meta alone handles 10% of the world’s data traffic  and 
22% of all mobile traffic.  Owning infrastructure ensures quality, minimizes risk, and 
reduces reliance on telecom companies. Countries with clean energy resources have 
a significant   opportunity to attract investment by building sustainable, low-carbon 
data centers, creating a competitive edge in the digital economy.

 Germany at a crossroads 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Automaking is central to Germany's manufacturing strength. Less than a decade 
ago, Germany was the world's main car exporter, but now China has taken that 
position. The strikes at Volkswagen plants this week in Germany highlight the 
economic and societal challenges the country is facing. Volkswagen plans to shut 
down 3 manufacturing sites and cut salaries by 10%. This would be the first time 
ever the company closes a plant and these are things that would have been 
unimaginable a few years ago. Upcoming elections in 2025 could bring significant   
changes. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Europe, and particularly the German model, is at a crossroads. Uncertainty looms 
about what comes next. Political shifts are underway, with parties such as AfD 
proposing drastic changes to Germany's participation in the European Union. The 
struggles of Germany's economy, its manufacturing sector, and the automotive 
industry's difficulty in adapting to market shifts—especially in electric vehicles—are 
interconnected with societal and political transformations. Germany and Europe 
have a challenging road ahead, and in some way, we will all be part of this journey.

 Robots: From promise to presence 
↳ Why does it matter? 
When robots learn like humans, they'll cross a major threshold and become more 
present in our physical world. Advancements in AI have allowed for significant   
progress with large language models (LLMs), but not yet with physical reality. The 
news emerging about robots developing learning capabilities is remarkable and 
could transform manufacturing, logistics, work and life. We may be about to cross a 
major frontier. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The promise of robots isn't new, but like all technologies, robotics goes through a 
disappointment phase before becoming dominant. We may be reaching the end of 
that phase. About a month ago, Tesla showcased the third version of its Optimus 
robot. Other companies, such as Figure, are making similar strides. Expect 
acceleration in 2025 and beyond. We'll see more humanoid robots featured in media 
and soon by our side. Be mindful.

The European Union is a major institutional achievement and one of the world's 
largest economies, with over 447 million people—more than 740 million in Europe as 
----------------Page (220) Break----------------
a whole. Europe is the birthplace of Western civilization. Changes in Europe affect 
not just the continent but the entire world. Understanding Europe's future is 
important for all of us. Currently, Europe faces significant   pressures due to fractures 
within the EU and what can be perceived as an exhaustion of its model. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Since 2008, Europe has been lagging behind, and a new administration in the U.S. 
could add more pressure. There's a surprising lack of dynamism, especially given 
Europe's contributions to technology, global corporations, culture, and human 
progress in values and well-being. What's missing? It seems the model is broken, but 
solutions aren't in sight. Political turbulence may increase. It's crucial to keep an eye 
on how things evolve. It's not just Europe's future at stake; Western democracies are 
facing challenges. They haven't delivered to citizens as expected. We should closely 
watch developments in Europe, especially as leadership roles rotate and bring new 
perspectives.

 It’s a brute game 
↳ Why does it matter? 
AI is becoming a brute force game. A recent survey in Nature shows that scientists 
are struggling to keep up with industry due to lack of infrastructure, computing 
power, energy, and funding. Yet, AI has immense potential. Software engineers have 
seen productivity double in just a few months using AI tools like co-pilots, reducing 
development time by 50%. However, the high costs associated with AI mean most of 
the world lacks the resources to compete. This raises a big question: Can AI be an 
equalizer, or will it amplify existing differences? 
↳ My thoughts on it 
It’s both. AI could unlock productivity gains that help those at the bottom of the 
pyramid, but that’s a tricky proposition. The survey focused on advanced economies; 
if their universities are behind industry, imagine the gap elsewhere. I see so much 
potential in AI—I can’t imagine life without it now. But how can we use it to improve 
the world? Strategically, countries have limited room to maneuver due to high 
resource demands—think Latam, Africa, Southeast Asia... Most lack the governance 
and strategic capabilities to make focused decisions. That’s worrisome. As always, 
tech is not the constraint.

 Dangerous fields 
↳ Why does it matter? 
In short: because the risk of escalation. On November 21, Russia used a new type of 
mid-range balistic hypersonic MIRV missile to attack Ukraine. Just days before, the 
United States authorized Ukraine to use American missiles to reach targets inside 
Russia. Recent reports suggest Russia may (or is suggesting it can) deploy these 
new defense technologies to the Asia-Pacific  region. Tensions are increasing, raising 
questions about how to de-escalate the situation and end the conflict.  
↳ My thoughts on it 
As Clausewitz once said, the war is a continuation of politics by other means. The 
conflict  in Ukraine is not new, it has been developing for over a decade and had a 
burst in 2021 with the Russian invasion. Increasingly, each side pushes the other into 
more dangerous territory. What will be the outcome if this dynamic is continued? 
Some in the West believe (I don’t have intel and I am not qualified   to make an 
assessment) that Russia will exhaust its technological, financial, political, and 
military resources, but that may not be a safe bet for all of us in this planet. It would 
be wiser if we could avoid a nuclear conflict.  Watch closely the next moves, from all 
sides.

 Reality imposes itself 
↳ Why does it matter? 
For the first time, the African Union (AU) participated as a full member at the G20 
meeting in Rio de Janeiro last week. Africa is the fastest-growing continent, 
expected to exceed 4 billion people by the end of the century. It has immense 
potential—imagine the market—and significant   challenges. Including Africa in global 
conversations is crucial. Ignoring it could lead to serious consequences—imagine 
the turmoil if hundreds of millions migrate to Europe in search of something very 
basic: opportunities. However, the AU's participation was barely noticed in 
mainstream media. Aren’t we missing something here? Whatever it is, at some point, 
reality imposes itself—the scale of Africa's challenges and opportunities can no 
longer be overlooked. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
While much of the Western media focused on President Xi Jinping's visit to Latin 
America, including the opening of a new port in Peru, the inclusion of the African 
Union in the G20 could signify a fundamental change. China's economic influence in 
Latin America is growing. However, by the end of the century, China's population is 
projected to halve compared to today’s level, while Africa's will be 5–6 times larger 
than that of China. Africa holds immense potential—with abundant natural resources 
and a young, dynamic population—and even Venture Capital, still limited and new, is 
growing there despite the ‘dry markets’ in most of the globe. A final question: with 
the African Union's addition, shouldn’t the Forum now be called the G21? Something 
to think about.

 Voltswagen may be in the horizon 
↳ Why does it matter? 
The future of cars is electric. In China, electric cars and plug-in hybrids already hold 
over 50% of the market share. Rivian, a U.S.-based electric vehicle manufacturer, is 
facing supply chain issues that have prevented it from meeting its production 
forecasts, and it's running low on cash. Volkswagen, a major automaker, is losing 
market share in China and globally, and has lagged behind in electric vehicles. As 
Marc Andreessen said, "Software is eating the world," and Volkswagen risks being 
left behind. A potential partnership between Volkswagen and Rivian could benefit  
both parties. 
----------------Page (225) Break----------------
↳ My thoughts on it 
It's notable how the German economy, and Europe in general, have been stagnating 
since the 2008 financial crisis. The automotive industry is critical for Germany's 
economy and significant   shifts driven by technological change and the rise of China 
are impacting it. German automakers are struggling to adapt and most reactions so 
far have been defensive - expect more protectionism. A partnership between 
Volkswagen and Rivian could be promising. Time will tell, but the future of these two 
companies—and perhaps even the German economy—is connected to such 
developments. We should keep an eye on these developments. But never forget: joint 
ventures can be challenging.

 Be ready, nuclear fusion is coming 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Nuclear energy is crucial for decarbonization, especially as power consumption 
surges due to the rise of AI and electrification,  such as electric vehicles. It offers 
reliable, clean baseline power and resilience to geopolitical shifts. Advancements in 
nuclear technology are introducing innovations beyond traditional large fission 
reactors, including small modular reactors and the progressing promise of fusion 
energy. In 2022, experiments in the U.S. and U.K. achieved net energy gain from 
fusion, and nuclear fusion startups are entering the market. Realizing fusion's 
potential could lead to unprecedented energy abundance, disrupting energy markets 
and causing a massive global shift. However, fusion has been a moving target, and 
new models are needed to accelerate its market integration. 
----------------Page (226) Break----------------
↳ My thoughts on it 
Nuclear fusion has been a moving target. The largest project in the world, ITER in 
France, involves many nations, including Russia. It's faced significant   budget 
overruns. Now, a profusion of startups are joining the race, and there's healthy 
competition between big government projects like ITER and private startups. 
Different technologies are vying for success: tokamaks vs. laser fusion. It's an 
exciting moment. Some say fusion could reach the market in 10 years, as colleagues 
from Longview Fusion. But new solutions and initiatives are still needed to 
accelerate fusion technology into the market, and we should expect more and more 
news about it in the years to come. Get ready—the world may be transformed in our 
lifetime.

 Tales of a shifting world 
↳ Why does it matter? 
China has become the main trade partner of Latin America—a significant   shift in 
recent decades. Latin American countries mainly export agricultural products and 
minerals to China. The opening of the Chancay port in Peru this past week has great 
significance.  It was built with substantial Chinese investment and will facilitate 
China's access to these commodities. It will also give South American food and 
mineral producers a competitive edge in the global market, lowering their logistics 
costs. The port is already the largest in the region, and this development occurs 
----------------Page (227) Break----------------
amid growing geopolitical competition between the United States and China, which 
complicates matters. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Latin America is poorly integrated, with underdeveloped infrastructure connecting its 
countries—it is faster to fly from Brasilia (Brazil) to Miami (USA) than to La Paz 
(Bolivia). Historically, Brazil and Spanish-speaking nations in Latin America have 
looked north to Europe, the U.S., and China, but not to others in the region. Building 
infrastructure is crucial at both regional and national levels—there are significant   
infrastructure and investment gaps across the region. Countries need capital to 
invest and access to global markets. This new port could reduce shipping times by 
ten days between China and Brazil (when land connections are fully built), benefiting  
not just Brazil but also Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, and Colombia. From a Latin 
American perspective, it's about making critical investments and finding growth 
opportunities. Geopolitics is actually a constraint. Are Latin American countries 
ready to operate in this complex world?

Saudi Arabia and Iran are major players in the Middle East. Historically seen as 
enemies, they have re-established diplomatic relations in a breakthrough deal 
facilitated by China. Amid escalating violence in the region, this rapprochement 
signals a potential path to peace and a new global alignment. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The Western media hasn't widely covered this development. The world is more 
complex than the simplistic narratives often presented in mainstream media. And... 
as Jeff Bezos recently wrote, media ranks at the bottom of what people trust. With 
Saudi Arabia considering joining BRICS and Iran already a member, new relationships

 Drones: where do they come from? 
----------------Page (229) Break----------------
↳ Why does it matter? 
The nature of war is changing. Instead of big, multibillion-dollar systems, we're 
seeing small, cheap devices in large quantities playing key roles on the battlefield.   
Drones are at the center of this shift. The conflict  between Ukraine and Russia 
showcases new technologies. Asymmetric warfare is gaining momentum. Supply 
chains for drone components are global. Access to these parts is crucial for 
dominance. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
We'll see many changes arising from technological growth. The idea of big 
technology being challenged by small technology will gain momentum. Distributed 
attacks using thousands of drones instead of a single multibillion-dollar aircraft 
represent a fundamental change. We're witnessing a democratization of certain 
tools and weapons. As the world becomes more fragmented, nations will need to 
build capacity for things they lack. We'll see more of this in the years to come. I’d

 Who will fund the future? 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Sustainability is a major challenge, and we’re not advancing in the energy transition 
at the pace needed. Recent data shows the climate is changing faster than 
anticipated, with rising temperatures that we're all experiencing. The developing 
world is particularly vulnerable to these impacts. The big question is: Where will the 
funding for green transitions and sustainable infrastructure come from? Private 
investments aren’t materializing as many predicted or pundits suggested. Without 
investment, we won’t be able to tackle the problem effectively. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The path to follow will depend on where the country falls within the matrix. Like with 
personal savings, we all invest seeking returns. If money isn't flowing into 
sustainable green tech and infrastructure, it's because these projects either aren't 
delivering the expected yields or are perceived as too risky. The green transition and 
development won’t happen without investment, and whether we like it or not, 
governments—who represent the collective interests of society—need to be involved. 
We must break the false dilemma between the state and the private sector. This is 
especially relevant for emerging countries. If we fail to address this, we will all face 
serious consequences—including the rich ‘Global North’.

universe, nature, and critical materials like semiconductors. 
China is advancing in developing science tools and technology capabilities, further 
accelerating its role in the global race for dominance in critical tech sectors, 
including semiconductors. Those who lack cutting-edge tools risk being left behind. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The technological competition between the U.S. and China underscores the need to 
consider security in broader terms—not just in defense, but in economic security and 
national prosperity. Certain technologies play a more critical role in this context. 
While the long-term effects of U.S. sanctions on China are yet to be fully understood, 
it's evident that China has the capacity to advance research and technology in key 
areas despite internal challenges. China's primary challenge today comes from 
within, not external pressures. Time will tell how this unfolds, and we should all 
remain vigilant about what comes next.

 BRICS Pay: Shifting Global Trade Dynamics 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Money matters for everything in life and the world. Today, countries mostly use 
currencies like the US dollar or euro for global trade, which limits nations with low 
----------------Page (233) Break----------------
international reserves—I can think of a few. It also creates costs due to currency 
conversion. The African Union estimates that trading in local currencies could save 
African countries $5 billion per year—they’ve implemented a system to enable that. 
The demonstration of the BRICS Pay system last week during the BRICS Business 
Forum in Russia, though still a prototype, is significant.  Beyond simplifying 
transactions and enabling trade, it carries geopolitical weight. Once operational at 
scale, BRICS Pay will reduce the U.S.'s ability to control the global economy and 
impose sanctions. This tech premiere signals a shift in the global landscape. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Distributed finance (DeFi) and blockchain hold enormous potential, enabling new 
types of transactions, processes, and businesses. Beyond that, DeFi could even 
reinvent the global economic order. 
We are just at the beginning, and the possibilities are enormous, with many of them 
'emergent.' BRICS Pay may fall into that category—perhaps an unexpected 
consequence, or maybe not. There’s much speculation about the origins of Bitcoin 
and blockchain. BRICS Pay could help companies in the global south conduct 
business more easily (from a user experience perspective, SWIFT is 
terrible—speaking from personal experience). This is definitely something to keep an 
eye on.

 And the Nobel goes to... 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Artificial intelligence is indeed transforming the world, and the recent Nobel Prizes 
awarded to Google DeepMind researchers and Geoffrey Hinton (who worked for 
Google 2013-2023) underscore AI's significant   impact. DeepMind's work in 
predicting protein folding has surpassed expectations, showcasing how AI can drive 
scientific   breakthroughs with vast implications. Big tech companies are no longer 
just market players; they are now at the forefront of cutting-edge science, gaining 
recognition and scrutiny alike. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
----------------Page (235) Break----------------
Big tech holds a fundamental position today. While companies like Google face 
scrutiny and the US Department of Justice considers asking for its unbundling, their 
research capabilities are astounding. This prominence is about resources, but also 
importantly about organizational models, methods, and mindsets. We need to 
consider how the incentives and processes in science compare (and are perhaps 
below) to those in big tech. To solve big problems quickly, innovation in 
long-established models and organizational setups is needed. Additionally, a big 
question remains: Will AI itself be awarded top scientific   honors such as the Nobel in 
the years to come?

↳ Why does it matter? 
SpaceX has achieved an incredible engineering feat. Imagine a 15-story building 
launching into space and then returning to land precisely where it started. That's 
exactly what happened with SpaceX's "Mechazilla," which caught the Super Heavy 
booster with its "chopsticks." This marks a major step in reinventing the space 
economy. With this innovation, space access costs are expected to drop 
tenfold—just as they did in the past with reusable rockets. And now, SpaceX is set to 
do it again. This is big. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
----------------Page (236) Break----------------
SpaceX is an emblematic company, with achievements that are truly unparalleled. It 
blends an entrepreneurial mindset with clever engineering. Government support 
certainly helped kickstart it, and government funding continues to fuel it today. Yet, 
SpaceX exemplifies   the power of questioning the status quo (why? why are things as 
they are?), delving deep into why things are the way they are, and reimagining them. 
Above all, it’s a testament to the success of deep thinking, audacious goals, and bold 
approaches to solving problems.

↳ Why does it matter? 
The promise of robots as daily companions hasn't been fully realized—until now. 
Technology evolves in phases, and we might be at a turning point. Seeing Tesla's 
Optimus walk into a room, interact with people, and even prepare drinks was 
incredible. This represents a major engineering achievement in both hardware and 
software, but it’s also much more. Musk's forecasted price of $20,000 to $30,000 for 
these robots is astonishing. This past week was a landmark moment in tech, and it 
will certainly go down in history. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The future is closer than you think. In many ways, it's already here. I’ve written about 
robotics before—BMW, for example, is using advanced robots like Figure 02, built in 
California. But this is different. With the prospects of truly functional humanoid 
robots entering our daily lives—not just being confined  to shop floors or storage 
----------------Page (237) Break----------------
centers—things are speeding up. I’m currently in Japan, where robots are part of life 
in various ways, from manufacturing environments to daily routines. Robots like 
Honda’s Asimo, the dog robot, and the Lovots that greet you and behave like pets 
never quite went mainstream in the West, but functional, human-like robots could 
change everything. This shift demands our attention. Stay tuned and follow closely. 
And... watch your back—a robot may be coming for your job. Big congrats to Elon 
Musk.

Reopening a nuclear power plant that was completely shut down, as Microsoft will 
do, is unprecedented. The Palisades plant in Michigan, set to reopen by 2025, will be 
the first. This signals a fundamental trend of our time: the world needs clean energy, 
and AI is hungry for it. Big tech companies have committed to the energy transition, 
but where will the energy come from? It’s hard to imagine a scenario where nuclear 
isn't part of the equation. New technologies are emerging in the nuclear 
space—small reactors, fusion energy, and the revival of old nuclear plants. Expect 
more from the nuclear front. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Three Mile Island is emblematic—the accident there was the worst in U.S. 
commercial nuclear power history. There’s fear about nuclear energy, as seen in 
movies like The China Syndrome and documentaries on Chernobyl, Fukushima, and 
Three Mile Island. But this debate is necessary. We need energy... and we fly planes 
despite of the risks—we’ve learned to manage risks in critical technologies. This 
announcement also highlights the influence and resources that big tech companies 
wield today. Big tech is taking on big projects and investing in research. Currently, 
80% of U.S. R&D and about a third of basic science research comes from industry. 
The rise of big tech shapes a new reality and leaves many questions on the table.

suggests a tougher stance on China and an expanded mandate for the Self Defense 
----------------Page (239) Break----------------
Forces, which could oversee US bases in Japan and potentially establish bases in 
the US. Ideas like forming a NATO-like alliance in the Pacific  are unlikely to sit well 
with China. This is not only significant   for Japan but also a critical global security 
issue. The administration will likely face pressure from abroad, and the coalition's 
stability will be tested. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Japan needs change. It no longer has the economic strength it once did and has 
become a follower in key areas like semiconductors. The issue with China isn't just a 
Japanese or American concern—it’s a global one, and we will all feel the 
consequences. Paying attention is crucial. The big questions are: (i) Is there clarity 
on the structural transformations needed to revitalize the economy and society? (ii) 
Can a relatively weak political coalition undertake such changes?

 No time to loose in China 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Semiconductors are crucial for any nation aiming to play in the major leagues. Last 
week’s announcements of new advanced chips designed and manufactured in China 
matter a lot. The prospect of China catching up in this area is remarkable. The 
computer chip competition between China and the U.S. is one of the most significant   
of our times. It’s possible that U.S. sanctions have actually accelerated China's 
semiconductor development. This is an intricate dynamic, with lessons to be learned 
----------------Page (240) Break----------------
by policymakers, business strategists, entrepreneurs, investors, and scientists alike. 
Facts are unfolding. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
China has set up several specialized funds to advance technology and drive growth 
in various business areas. But how much was invested? Was the money used wisely? 
Perhaps the most relevant question isn’t about that, but about the value China is 
gaining—or even more, what it would lose if it gave up on advanced chip technology. 
From a distance, and given my limited expertise in semiconductors, it’s hard to tell 
what’s real or not. I’d love to see unbiased technical assessments of China's new 
chips. Will experts in the West have access to them? This is a long game—stay 
tuned. A curiosity: how did China achieve this without Western lithography

 Signals of change in the commercial aircraft 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Commercial and private aircraft manufacturing is a $160 billion annual market. It's 
tech-intensive, complex, and big business. Only a few countries can produce and 
market aircraft globally. High barriers to entry exist. Reputation, service, and 
meticulous engineering processes are crucial. We haven't seen big changes in this 
market for a long time. But this may change with new technologies and new players 
leveraging them. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Boeing and Airbus together hold over 90% of the global commercial aircraft market. 
Companies like Embraer, Bombardier, and a Chinese company are junior players. 
Developing a new aircraft requires substantial investment and is a risky business. 
Even Mitsubishi failed and canceled a commercial plane project. Now, new 
technologies open new opportunities—supersonic aviation, space planes, eVTOLs, 
and new energy planes like hydrogen and electric. This week,  news came from 
Boom Supersonic and Radian. These may be new players entering the market, along 
with various eVTOL manufacturers I mentioned before in this Weekly Snapshot. The 
big question remains: Will consumers feel safe and adopt these new products?

 Geography matters in finance 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Financial hubs attract not just capital but also talent. They're symbols of global 
relevance, power and economic sophistication. Hong Kong was in decline after being 
absorbed by China, the pandemic and the crackdown on pro-democracy protests. 
This week, Hong Kong regained the third position among global financial hubs, 
overtaking Singapore. This may signal a change, challenging mainstream narratives 
about China. Interestingly, though unrelated, this happens in the same week when 
China announces a new stimulus package to accelerate economic growth. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The NYSE and NASDAQ represent 40% of the world's market cap, and NY stays at the 
top. Chinese financial hubs were falling in recent rankings and dropped again in this 
latest announcement. So, what's the meaning of Hong Kong's rise? It shows the city's 
competitiveness in attracting capital and its role as a bridge to mainland China. For 
China, it's positive news to share. But we still need to understand the implications for 
the world: a further drive toward multilateralism, currency diversification—as  Hong 
Kong is a major foreign exchange hub—and an impulse to fintech and digital money 
in Asia are all possibilities. These developments deserve closer examination. Keep 
your eyes open and your wallets alert.

 Friendly fire may cause casualties in the chips war 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Semiconductor technology is crucial for any country aiming to be a top global player. 
We are witnessing a global chips race or war. The US and China are aggressively 
investing to develop indigenous semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and 
capacity. Japan, once a relevant player, is trying to regain its footing. India, with big 
conglomerates like Tata and Reliance, is entering semiconductors with government 
support. Today’s news about Taiwan's PSMC pulling out from a project in Japan and 
partnering with India is revealing. Competition is on all fronts: technology, talent, 
investments and global partnerships. Friendly nations may be caught in the crossfir e. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Japan now lacks semiconductor expertise and needs foreign partners. Personally, 
this is mind-blowing—I was trained in lean manufacturing, worked with Japanese 
engineers, and went to Japan to learn and benchmark manufacturing technology. 
While semiconductors are critical, the outcomes of today's competition are unclear. 
Vietnam is gaining momentum, taking advantage of US decoupling from China, and 
plans to train 50,000 semiconductor engineers by 2030. 
Indian conglomerates rely on government stimulus and partnerships with foreign 
companies to build local capacity. Europe and Japan are trying to catch up through 
various initiatives, including the expected outcomes from the recently announced 
Draghi report in Europe. 
----------------Page (244) Break----------------
The results of the US curbing China's access to semiconductors are also 
uncertain—this may end up accelerating China's development of semiconductor tech, 
time will tell. However, one thing is certain: countries without semiconductor 
capabilities and capacity, especially big ones, will be left behind.

 Innovation: DARPA continues to inspire 
↳ Why does it matter? 
----------------Page (245) Break----------------
Innovation drives economic growth. Countries that create key technologies and turn 
them into global businesses gain a competitive edge, particularly in the deep tech 
domain. Many have tried to emulate the US DARPA, but none have succeeded yet. In 
2023, the UK launched a new agency following DARPA's example, giving autonomy to 
highly qualified   managers. They have just become operational and hired the initial 
team. It's important to watch and learn from this experience. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
In physics, math, natural sciences, computation, biology, and much more, the UK has 
made fundamental impacts. Think of recent breakthroughs like COVID-19 vaccines. 
Europe is lagging behind and aims to catch up, as the recent Draghi Report suggests. 
Controlling critical technologies is vital for the economy, society, and security. But 
research is not enough: knowledge must be translated into commercial ventures in 
key areas, and deep tech is essential to reaching the top of the pyramid. 
Manufacturing capacity is key, as Japan's semiconductor efforts show. Expect more

 Global science: fragmentation is the new normal 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Science was once a global enterprise, even during the Cold War. Not anymore. Over 
150,000 Chinese students study in Australian universities. But now, a research 
trained in Australia can't easily move to a postdoc in Beijing and later to California. 
Paths are closing. Recent news of CERN limiting collaborations with Russia and 
----------------Page (246) Break----------------
getting ready to expel scientists marks a significant   shift. A fast-fragmenting world is 
setting science systems apart. This will possibly hinder scientific   development. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
CERN began collaborating with the Soviet Union in 1955. During the Cold War, the 
U.S. engaged in science projects with Eastern Europe and Russia. Knowing that, it’s 
easy to see how significant   the changes are. Fragmentation is also felt in cyberspace 
and communications. The Internet and satellites used for global positioning provide 
examples. We shouldn't be surprised to see fragmentation of technical standards 
and protocols soon. It may not be that far off.

 Geostrategy: the challenge of strategic flexibility 
↳ Why does it matter? 
The global geostrategic competition between the US and China limits options for 
emerging nations. Imagine a company with two big clients but forced to choose just 
one—that limits revenue. Navigating today's context requires strategic capabilities 
most countries lack. Are mediation or neutrality possible now? Learning from 
Malaysia and others is crucial to understand today's possibilities. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
----------------Page (247) Break----------------
Geography is absolute and imposes itself. Countries like Malaysia, Mexico, and 
Kazakhstan are heavily influenced  by their powerful neighbors. The post-Cold War 
order has changed. Geopolitical competition sets new boundaries and narrows 
development paths. Nations must develop the capabilities to position themselves 
and decide if, when, and how to partner with others.

 An e-mobility tsunami is coming from the South 
↳ Why does it matter? 
The main barriers to electric vehicles are associated with their autonomy (batteries 
and infrastructure included) and price points. The fastest-growing markets for all 
types of vehicles are in the global south. In China, 50% of sales are electric or hybrid. 
India is following; while the percentage is still low, EV sales were up 41% in Q1 2024. 
Success in emerging markets that have infrastructure problems and demand 
----------------Page (248) Break----------------
cheaper products than in advanced nations can prepare companies to succeed 
elsewhere. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
India has native automakers, like Tata Motors and Mahindra, and various motorcycle 
and three-wheel manufacturers. Those companies are national assets. The country 
could potentially follow China's path in EVs. If companies succeed in EVs in the 
Indian market, it means they're well-positioned to expand globally. Emerging markets

 Breakthroughs give momentum  to quantum computing 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Quantum computing is a key technology frontier. While classical computers handle 
linear problems well, quantum computers promise to solve complex issues much 
faster, such as atomic and biological simulations and combinatorial problems. 
However, today's quantum systems show errors, unlike stable traditional computers. 
Fixing these errors is crucial for quantum computing to be adopted and scaled up, 
and this past week’s announcements in the US and Australia move in that direction. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The US, China, Europe, and others are investing heavily in quantum technologies, 
particularly computing. Once fully developed, proven, made reliable, and scaled, 
quantum computers can provide capabilities we don't yet have. They will also render 
----------------Page (249) Break----------------
current cybersecurity systems obsolete. Dominating quantum technology means 
gaining a competitive edge in everything from biology to national security. Expect

 The climate clock is ticking and we are not prepared 
↳ Why does it matter? 
We're facing severe climate events globally. Nevertheless, we lack the models, 
protocols, practical tools, and, in most places, the resources to handle them. Climate 
change will affect everyone—our economies, societies, and lives. Brazil, the 
second-largest food exporter in the world, is forecasted to see significant   crop yield 
reductions. This won't just impact Brazil but global food chains and food security 
worldwide. We are losing natural resources at an unprecedented speed. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The massive costs of climate change aren't fully accounted for. Hidden costs could 
devalue or erase assets. Emerging nations, lacking developed infrastructure, are 
most at risk. They face the challenge of rebuilding while addressing social realities. 
Where will the money come from? The toll will be both financial and human, with 
global social cohesion at risk. We need—and will see—more innovation in everything, 
from fire prevention to carbon capture, from policy to agricultural practices. The big 
question is: will we have time? Are we ready to say goodbye to nature?

 Mars is coming to us 
↳ Why does it matter? 
The space economy is expected to triple by the end of the next decade. Space is a 
key frontier for tech, investment, and global competition. The impact of space 
programs on Earth is well documented. China and the US are the only two countries

to have successfully landed payloads on Mars. A successful Chinese mission 
bringing samples from Mars to Earth, like the one announced last week, could give 
the country a competitive edge in this global race and in various technology areas. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The US, China, and India are the frontrunners in the space race—yes, I think Russia 
and Europe have lost momentum, but I could be very wrong. India’s low-cost, fast 
progress is remarkable. China succeeding in bringing samples from Mars ahead of 
the US would be a major achievement. The US has massive resources and

highlights the complex dynamics that BRICS faces. As the group expands, managing 
diverse interests becomes harder and the need for some kind of structure becomes 
more evident. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
BRICS is an acronym in search of a soul. China drove much of the economic growth

are the search for new capital and growth sources and a desire to advance 
relationships and frameworks that are not dominated or mediated by Western

 AI regulation gains momentum  
↳ Why does it matter? 
----------------Page (254) Break----------------
California's economy is driven by technology. The state legislature just passed 
legislation to regulate AI. Bill SB-1047, supported by Elon Musk to the surprise of 
some, mandates companies to implement a controversial "kill switch.” This is 
pioneering legislation of this type and is also part of an emerging global issue. 
Expect more AI regulations worldwide. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Balancing regulation and innovation is tough, especially in fast-moving tech areas. 
Governor Newsom will need to decide whether to sign the bill into law or not. For an 
economy driven by tech and digital, this is critical. Governments globally will soon 
face similar decisions. Speed matters and societies aren't prepared to deal with 
digital tech. From a policy perspective, it is essential to build a body of knowledge on 
the matter, distill lessons, and structure best practices.

 A drone may be coming for you 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Drones are now key in warfare, as seen in Russia, Ukraine, and the Middle East. Their 
use is spreading globally, even to non-state actors. This signals the rise of 
asymmetric warfare, which is becoming the norm. It also highlights the challenges 
that come with new technologies and their democratization. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
----------------Page (255) Break----------------
Citizens dodging drones feels like sci-fi,  but it's real and already happening. Today, 
most drones are piloted remotely (like the FPVs being used by the Ukrainian military), 
but autonomous AI-powered drones are inevitable. The risk isn't just military 
use—soon, anyone could have this power, including organized crime, terrorists, and 
rogue individuals. Are law enforcement agencies ready?

 Capital shifts 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Capital is concentrated in advanced economies. However, shifts are happening. 
China’s foreign investment grew over 5,700% from 2002 to 2022, and the UAE’s grew 
5,500%, while the outflow   of EU’s FDI was reduced by 48%. For comparison: 
American FDI grew 176%, and the world’s grew 200%. These emerging capital hubs 
are increasingly connecting their financial markets. This is being coupled with the 
digitalization of currencies and the expansion of cross-border payment systems. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Capital available for emerging nations is shifting hands. Countries like the UAE and 
China bring new rules for engagement. We'll see new financial tools emerging from 
these new global capital hubs and more connections between their markets. 
Understanding the dynamics and being capable of connecting with new sources of 
capital is key to seizing opportunities in a changing world, for businesses and 
emerging countries. This challenges the influence of advanced economies in the 
Global South, and tensions may arise.

 Atoms matter in geopolitics and business 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Global demand for critical minerals is surging (e.g.: the demand for Lithium grew 
30% in 2023, Cobalt ~10%), with production concentrated in a few areas. China, 
anticipating this trend, has better coordinated its efforts, dominating production and 
expanding access in Africa. These minerals are vital for manufacturing computer 
chips, electronics, clean tech, and advanced materials. This move will increase 
tensions and can accelerate moves. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
----------------Page (257) Break----------------
We’re likely to see more U.S.-China curbs, with the U.S. targeting high-tech and China 
focusing on minerals. It is a lose-lose game, and a dangerous one. This dynamics 
will drive more investment in mineral and tech research in the West. New methods 
for locating, harvesting, and processing minerals are needed, along with accelerated 
development of synthetic minerals and urban mining. This trend also reinforces 
nationalization and ‘friend shoring’ efforts-in mineral production, manufacturing, and 
across supply chains.

 AR/VR still has to surpass the ‘deceptive’ phase 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Facebook acquired Oculus in March 2014. From 2020 to 2024, its metaverse division 
reportedly lost $42 billion. Market forecasts for AR, VR, and the metaverse have 
fallen short, with products like Meta's Quest and Apple's Vision Pro underperforming. 
The products are expensive, are not selling as expected and, a rarely disclosed 
statistics, 40% of users suffer nausea when wearing VR googles. Is this the end? No, 
it's a big opportunity. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The AR/VR market in 2024 is valued at about $30 billion, with an estimated 35% 
annual growth until the decade's end. Despite this, consumer adoption is lagging. 
We're in the "deception phase," where early expectations haven't been met, but this 
signals opportunities for new technologies and producers. A breakthrough AR/VR 
technology, offering experiences with devices much like everyday glasses (I’ve seen 
----------------Page (258) Break----------------
and handled a proof of concept—get in contact in you want to know where), is on the 
horizon. It's just a matter of time. The key question is who will invest to accelerate 
development and build the necessary business structure to gain the market.

 From the biotech front: a first for LatAm 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Zoonotic virus jumps are on the rise, making pandemics and epidemics more 
frequent. There are 51 BSL-4 labs in operation worldwide. Latin America, with 670 
million people, has lacked a high-security biolab—until now. Brazil is leading with the 
first such facility in the region. This is significant   for health, technological, and 
management advancements in the country and Latin America. It's also a world first, 
combining a synchrotron light source with a high-security biolab. This feat displays 
ambition, addresses a real need, and will create opportunities to advance critical 
capabilities. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
CNPEM is a complex of Brazilian national labs, government-funded but managed by 
a non-profit.  It embodies much-needed institutional innovation in Brazil, Latin 
America, and the emerging world at large. CNPEM's model is the closest alignment 
within Brazilian legal constraints to the U.S. national labs model. The new BSL-4 lab 
will bring challenges, particularly in funding, technical integration with the light 
----------------Page (259) Break----------------
source, and human resources. Developing specialized skills and implementing the 
processes needed for the secure operation of the new lab will be crucial and cannot 
be neglected. Overcoming these challenges can create significant   opportunities and 
even inspire other emerging nations—yes, we can. But institutional improvement is 
essential to turning challenges into opportunities.

 German automakers bet on wheel hub motors 
↳ Why does it matter? 
----------------Page (260) Break----------------
German carmakers are losing ground in China and globally. What could potentially 
change the game? A tech breakthrough. Porsche introduced in-wheel drive to the 
world in 1900, but the project was eventually abandoned. Hyundai announced its on 
wheel motor in Nov 2023. Now, a German startup claims to have developed a version 
that is 20% more efficient than standard EVs, and BMW is testing it. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Sales of EVs and hybrids in China now account for 50% of the total market. It is 
increasingly difficult  for foreign automakers to penetrate the Chinese market. 
Whether ‘hub motors’ can change the game remains to be seen. However, this new 
technology could further lower EV prices and reduce total ownership costs, 
potentially accelerating market penetration globally.

 UK launches into space 
↳ Why does it matter? 
The UK has been somewhat reserved in space exploration, with the UK Space 
Agency established only in 2010. However, space has become a major frontier, and 
interest in space technologies is growing globally, including for defense and warfare. 
On-Earth military operations increasingly depend on space capabilities. The launch 
of Tyche, a military Earth-imaging satellite, marks a significant   first for the UK. 
----------------Page (261) Break----------------
↳ My thoughts on it 
Tyche has a 90 cm resolution, while US and Chinese defense satellites achieve 10 
cm or higher. Expect more military activity in space and a revisitation of the 
International Outer Space Treaty and space law in general. While the UK strives to 
develop military space capabilities, its new space economy thrives, attracting more 
private investment in space than any country outside the US since 2015. Strong 
science capabilities could give the UK an edge.

 A breakthrough in protein design can enable future biobots 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Having the capacity to turn proteins "on" and "off" allows us to send instructions and 
perform logic operations (like "if") within biological structures. This is the first step 
toward creating "switchable" higher-order nanomaterials and, eventually, 
components such as pumps, conveyors, walkers, and even fully structured 
bio-machines and biobots. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
We are still in the early days of biodesign, and bio machines remain largely 
conceptual, but the promise and potential are immense. This fundamental 
development will accelerate research in the field and likely shorten the time needed 
----------------Page (262) Break----------------

 Google is a monopolist 
↳ Why does it matter? 
This was a first. Google epitomizes big tech and being ruled a monopoly by a court 
sets a fundamental precedent. Debates on regulating big tech are growing globally. 
The case sets a precedent for others in the US and for initiatives worldwide that aim 
to curtail big tech. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
----------------Page (263) Break----------------
Conflicts  between governments and big tech are escalating globally and will likely 
continue. The future influence of big tech on nations is uncertain, making this a key 
area of contention. Monitor the U.S. elections closely, as restrictions on big tech 
seem inevitable regardless of the outcome and will have global repercussions.

 A robot plays ping-pong during the Olympics season 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Sports are complex endeavors from a computational and modeling perspective. This 
feat by Deep Mind marks the first time a robot has played a sport with humans in a 
competitive way. Importantly, it was fun for the humans involved. Deep Mind used an 
innovative approach to train the AI algorithms that control the robot, and this new 
method can be applied in other contexts, such as manufacturing or piloting. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
The promise of human-like robots has not yet been realized, but we are getting 
closer. This case may be remembered as a turning point in the relationship between 
humans, robots, and sports. Have you seen the objective of the RoboCup? If not, 
follow the link to check it out. In the manufacturing world, Figure 2 robots have been 
deployed at a BMW factory in the US—also take a look at what UBTECH and Mentee

 The cybercrime treaty moved forward in the UN 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Cybercrime is rising at a rate of 15% per year. The global cost of cybercrime is 
expected to double by 2029, reaching $16 trillion. Most cybercrimes occur across 
borders, requiring countries to coordinate their actions. It's encouraging that even in 
a period of growing global tensions, the world finds space for some collaboration. 
↳ My thoughts on it 
Russia introduced the original draft for the cybercrime treaty, which was 
unanimously approved after three years of negotiations. Big tech and privacy civil 
society groups oppose the treaty, highlighting ongoing tensions between 
governments and tech companies. The outcomes remain to be seen. Between 
“surveillance state” and “big tech dominance,” the world faces challenges. Our 
institutions are not fit for the digital world.

 Uber closes a massive deal with BYD 
↳ Why does it matter? 
An American company just closed a deal with the top Chinese (and global) EV 
manufacturer. It's a first! And this will help lower EV prices even more and give BYD a 
big boost worldwide. In the same week, BYD announced it will make Brazil an export 
hub for EVs made there. 
↳ The implications 
By the way, I noticed this trend on the streets of São Paulo, Brazil. BYD vehicles have 
lower total ownership costs, which is great for Uber drivers compared to ICE models. 
This will give BYD an even bigger boost both locally and globally. It might also hint at 
a future move into the US market.

 Africa and China deepen digital partnership 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Africa is the fastest-growing continent with the youngest population. Tons of new 
digital-native business models are popping up all over. Data usage in Africa is 
increasing by more than 40% each year. Africa is becoming a major player in 
business and geopolitics, and what happens there can have a big impact on Europe 
and the rest of the world. 
↳ The implications 
In a world that craves data, Africa's role is becoming more important. Social unrest 
and poor living conditions could cause immigration flows that might destabilize 
Europe and beyond. Developing digital infrastructure, industries, skills, and jobs is 
crucial. Companies in the digital space, like Huawei, can really benefit.   It's surprising 
that Brazilian companies are hesitant to jump into this market.

 China finds signals of water in the Moon 
----------------Page (267) Break----------------
↳ Why does it matter? 
Water is the elixir of life, and its discovery on the Moon could be a cosmic 
game-changer. Imagine the possibilities: not only does this hint at the potential for 
extraterrestrial life, but it also opens doors to future lunar colonization. Thanks to 
China's Chang'e-6 mission, which has returned samples from the Moon’s mysterious 
far side, we’re one giant leap closer to unlocking these thrilling new frontiers. 
↳ The implications 
This discovery could supercharge the space race in two major ways. First, it paves 
the way for human settlements on the Moon by making lunar bases more feasible. 
Second, it signals China’s growing prowess in space, which could spark a flurry of 
activity from other nations, especially the US, ramping up investments and 
competition in space exploration and technology.

 India rises and the world has ‘surprising’ growth spots 
↳ Why does it matter? 
India has become a hotspot and presents opportunities for investors and 
transnational corporations that previously weren’t on the radar. Honda exporting 
vehicles from India to Japan signals efficiency and quality in Indian manufacturing. 
Growth is also coming from countries under sanctions and suggests that those 
measures are not working as many would expect. 
↳ The implications 
As India grows, we will see increased interest in the nation from across the world, 
but the capabilities and connections to do business there are not present 
everywhere—the US, Japan, and Russia are well-positioned. The Indian stock market 
can become hyped; watch Chinese and Brazilian stocks if that happens. There is 
historical and contemporary evidence that sanctions can be counterproductive, and 
the approach toward them in the US and Europe will increasingly be under scrutiny. 
In the meantime, US taxpayers may be paying for fancy meals in Moscow. All of this 
happens in the context of Ukraine and China discussing the war and recalling an old 
treaty between the countries. The world is complex.

 The AI race becomes physical 
↳ Why does it matter? 
AI models are progressing, but hardware is now also a major frontier for AI 
investment. This doesn't only mean designing and manufacturing chips but also 
owning those chips and the physical infrastructures on which they run—namely, data 
centers and their hardware components. Having access to these resources can 
present a competitive edge. This is not a shift per se but the opening of a new front 
in the AI race. Physical constraints apply—think power and water. 
↳ The implications 
New types of businesses and business models will emerge. Companies may shift 
focus—Yandex (popularly known in the past as “Russia’s Google”) provides an 
insightful example at the intersection of AI and the global geopolitical situation. VC 
firms focusing on AI, such as Andreessen Horowitz, are changing the investment 
dynamics in AI companies, using hardware to attract startups. Big tech and data 
center owners/operators are hungry for power, particularly clean power. The 
----------------Page (270) Break----------------
availability of clean energy and water will become a competitive advantage for 
regions and countries looking to attract that type of investment.

 The G20 talked CBDCs 
↳ Why does it matter? 
----------------Page (271) Break----------------
115 countries around the world are actively working on Central Bank Digital Currency 
(CBDC) projects. Many countries have advanced initiatives, such as China, the UAE, 
Brazil, and Thailand. CBDCs have the potential to transform global payments, impact 
banking and financial services providers, and shift the use of currencies globally. 
Cross-border payment systems based on CBDCs can further facilitate the use of 
local currencies in global trade. 
↳ The implications 
Everything is going digital, and money is no exception—when was the last time you 
used a coin or a bill? Not depending on foreign currencies presents economic 
benefits   to emerging nations, as the African examples illustrate. Back to the 
sanctions topic, those can erode trust in the dollar-based system, as Secretary Yellen 
hinted. Stay tuned and don't miss the bandwagon; a lot is likely to happen in the 
digital money realm, from both businesses and governments.

 China talked ‘reforms’ 
↳ Why does it matter? 
China is the world's second-largest economy. Growth slowed in Q2 2024 and 
geopolitical competition is at a high point. The most used words in the communiqué 
of the CPC Central Committee plenum were: reform, economy and market. Themes 
on the rise include security, technology, risk, productivity and quality. What do they 
mean? The future of the planet is closely tied to China and its relationship with the 
US. 
----------------Page (273) Break----------------
↳ The implications 
It is essential to understand China. American and global CEOs will fly to engage with 
leaders there and make sense of what they mean by ‘reform’, the prospects for the 
economy and global relations. US-China connections are becoming more scarce, 
which can lead to miscalculations and increase global risk. ‘Reading’ China is not for 
amateurs, but most of the emerging world (and others) lacks the necessary 
capabilities—who speaks and reads Chinese well and is acquainted with the Chinese 
reality in your country? Fasten your seat belts.

 The EU’s regulation on AI fuels the conversation about risks 
versus innovation 
↳ Why does it matter? 
AI is the hottest technology today, attracting significant   investment and attention, 
driving innovation, and creating value at warp speed. AI is hungry for energy and 
data. Having access to data at a low cost is a competitive advantage for AI 
companies. What data can they use? Countries are taking different paths to regulate 
AI, and that directly affects the business of AI companies and big tech, the lives of all 
of us, and national economies. 
----------------Page (274) Break----------------
↳ The implications 
It is very hard to regulate something that is poorly understood and is evolving fast. 
Economies are interconnected, and if a country curbs the moves of AI and digital 
tech companies, they may decide to move operations elsewhere, impacting 
innovation capacity and the economy. The whole discussion is about “Safeguarding 
citizens versus Fostering innovation.” Global coordination is key in this game, and 
even the US and China are collaborating on the matter. The future of AI regulation 
will depend a lot on the US election. Stay tuned.

 A hiccup in space exploration 
↳ Why does it matter? 
Space is a major frontier for science and innovation, and space exploration is a 
costly and risky business. NASA’s decision to cancel the rover that would search for 
water on the Moon has the potential to affect commercial endeavors. It also sends 
----------------Page (275) Break----------------
signals about the capacity of the US to continue investing to sustain its technology 
leadership. China has recently recovered samples from the dark side of the Moon, 
and other nations are ramping up space activities. NASA’s announcement comes as 
new discoveries on Mars point to the past existence of water on the planet. 
↳ The implications 
This is part of a larger play in the US. Due to the debt ceiling deal the administration 
struck with Congress, the National Science Foundation and other agencies are also 
struggling with their budgets. For global leadership, knowledge matters, and science 
and technology matter. On the other hand, this is a clear reminder that the future of 
private space exploration depends on government money, which trickles down from 
NASA contracts to the private sector. The new space economy still needs a push to 
take off. Hope? NASA is offering the rover to other space agencies, with 
manifestations of interest due on Aug 1.
